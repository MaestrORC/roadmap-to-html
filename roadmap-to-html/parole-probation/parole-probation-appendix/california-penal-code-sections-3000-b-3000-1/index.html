However, the period of parole is subject to the following:</p>
              <p class="text">(A) Except as provided in<span class="space"> </span>Section 3064, in no case may a prisoner subject to three years on parole be retained under parole supervision or in custody for a period longer than four years from the date of his or her initial parole.</p>
