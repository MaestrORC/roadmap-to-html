              <h1>Shelters</h1>
              <p class="text">Most shelters are free, and usually offer a bed and shower for one night or multiple nights, and sometimes services such as counseling and job-search assistance. While transitional and permanent housing options can take time to arrange, you can usually access a shelter immediately. Here are some of the main types of shelters that exist:</p>
              <ol class="text"><strong>24-hour Shelters</strong>—24-hour shelters let you to stay at night and during the day and participate in the services the shelter offers (for example: meals, counseling, and job training, just to name a few). Don’t let the name mislead you—a 24-hour shelter doesn’t necessarily mean you have to leave after 24 hours: in the Bay Area, for example, many 24-hour shelters have beds available for up to 30-90 days; and other shelters reserve beds for people who are participating in special programs, like a required work-program. The key is that 24-hour shelters are open day and night. Ask the specific shelter you’re interested in about any other requirements or restrictions it has.</ol>
              <ol class="text"><strong>12-hour Shelters</strong>—12-hour shelters let you stay for a 12-hour period overnight (usually 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.), but require you to leave in the morning.</ol>
              <ol class="text"><strong>Day Shelters</strong> let you come and take advantage of their services during the day, but you can’t stay overnight. Services at day shelters may include showers, meals, computer access, and optional programs like case management/support services and counseling sessions.</ol>
              <ol class="text"><strong>Family Shelters</strong> have places to stay for you and the rest of your family. They tend to be 24-hour shelters (see the first type of shelter listed above).</ol>
              <ol class="text"><strong>Domestic Violence Shelters</strong> take women (usually not men) who are trying to find safety from someone who is abusive. They usually have confidential addresses for the safety of the residents. Many domestic violence shelters also allow women to bring their children with them.</ol>
