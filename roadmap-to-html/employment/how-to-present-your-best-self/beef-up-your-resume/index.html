          <h2><a href="/employment/how-to-present-your-best-self/beef-up-your-resume/how-can-i-build-up-my-resume/">How can I build up my resume?</a></h2>
            <p class="text"><strong><em>1. Explore volunteer opportunities. </em></strong>Volunteering is a great way to learn new skills, gain solid references, find out about local job opportunities, and show potential employers that you are dedicated and responsible. Although it is usually unpaid, it strengthens your application and offers experiences you can talk about in your job search.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong><em>2. Go back to school. </em></strong>Going back to school to get your GED or advanced college or professional degree shows that you are responsible, focused and driven—all qualities that employers look for when hiring. As a practical matter, going back to school can offer you training to expand your skillset and qualify you for more jobs. </p>
            <p class="text"><strong><em>3. Participate in a reentry program. </em></strong>Employers will be impressed if you are proactive and take steps to grow and learn from challenging past situations. Reentry programs in your local area may be able to help you in your job search, and support you in your transition. To find out about reentry programs or other employment opportunities, we recommend that you attend local reentry fairs and/or talk to people (in prison or jail or outside) who might know about these programs. Ask your counselor or case manager, parole or probation officer, mentor or sponsor, or others for recommendations.</p>
            <h4 class="sidebox">TALK TO YOUR TRUSTED PERSON</h4>
            <p class="sidebox">Talk to your trusted person or someone at a workforce development program to see what school, work, and volunteer opportunities are available in your area, and for other ideas about how to build your resume and gain new skills.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong><em>4. Participate in workforce development (job readiness) programs. </em></strong>Many organizations have workforce development or job readiness programs for people with criminal records or other employment barriers. These programs help you to search for jobs, improve your job skills, and prepare for job applications and interviews. They provide services like job counseling, job training, resume writing, interview coaching, and sometimes job placement and referrals. </p>
            <p class="text">Even if there are no job readiness programs for people in reentry in your area, look for similar services. Sometimes the only workforce development program near you will be an America’s Job Center, which is run by the government. If the America’s Job Center is your only option, take advantage of the case managers and other programs there. If there are other workforce programs available in your area, try those first, as they often provide more individual attention and help. For a list of workforce development programs around the state, see Appendix B, PG. 614, or call 2-1-1 for local referrals.</p>
            <h4 class="textbox"><a id="EM_HH_EDD_OneStopCenter"></a>HELPFUL HINTWhat are America’s Job Centers of California?</h4>
            <p class="textbox">America’s Job Centers of California (once called One-Stop Career Centers) are job readiness centers run by the state through the California Employment Development Department (EDD), a state agency that assists workers and employers. America’s Job Centers provide FREE services and resources to people looking for work, including: job counseling to figure out what jobs are right for you; free access to phones, fax machines, computers, and Internet; job search and résumé writing workshops; community resources and referrals for training; and job fairs. To find an America’s Job Center near you, go to <a href="http://www.americasjobcenter.ca.gov/">www.americasjobcenter.ca.gov</a>.
