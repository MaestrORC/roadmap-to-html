              <h4>HERE ARE SOME GENERAL GUIDELINES ON ASKING FOR LETTERS OF SUPPORT. </h4>
              <div class="textstrongemphasis">General Reminders:</div>
              <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Make it as easy for people as possible!</span> People are busy and letters of support can take time to write. Some ways you can make it easier for the people you are asking to help you are:</ol>
              <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Give them plenty of time.</span> Don’t ask them 2 days before you need to turn in the letter. Give them plenty of time to work on it so they don’t feel rushed and can put thought into what they’re writing. </ol>
              <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Give them plenty of information</span>. Make sure to remind them of things they can write about, such as your accomplishments or your positive impact on them.</ol>
              <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Give them friendly reminders</span>. If someone hasn’t responded to you or hasn’t given you a letter by the date you asked to have it done by, try writing them a quick email or calling them. Be polite and not demanding. Your message should be along the lines of “I know you are busy, but I was curious if you will have any time to work on that letter of support I asked you about?” </ol>
              <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Have a variety of people write letters for you</span>. You should have letters from people who know as many different aspects of you as possible. Don’t get all of your letters from people who all know you from the same activity or area of your life. </ol>
              <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Keep it Short</span>. It is best to keep the letters short, about 1–2 pages. This will make them easier to read and also less time consuming to write. </ol>
