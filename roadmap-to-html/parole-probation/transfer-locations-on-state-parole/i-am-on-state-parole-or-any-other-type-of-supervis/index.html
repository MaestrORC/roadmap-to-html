        <h3>I am on state parole‚Äî<em>or any other type of supervision</em>‚Äîand I want to transfer to another<em> </em>state. How can I do that?</h3>
        <h4 class="sidebox">NOTE about interstate transfers:</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">The Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision also governs the rules for all interstate transfers of state probation, including PRCS and Mandatory Supervision. </p>
        <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINT</h4>
        <p class="textbox">Because there is a limit on the number of ‚Äúout-of-county‚Äù parolees who may be supervised in each county (meaning there‚Äôs a limit on transfers), once again, your request to transfer parole to another county in California may be denied even if some or all of these factors are favorable. It is best to put the strongest application possible forward, and to get as much support as you can, especially from your Parole Agent, correctional counselors, and anyone else you know working for the government‚Äîincluding judges, District Attorneys, Public Defenders, etc. It would also be great to get the support of leaders from the community you are hoping to transfer to. </p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: The information below about transferring supervision between states applies not just to state parole, but to <em>ALL forms of community supervision</em>. Keep reading if you are on state parole; county probation, PRCS, or mandatory supervision; or federal probation, supervised release or parole.</p>
        <p><em>First, some background:</em> a legal agreement between all of the states called <em>the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision</em> sets out the rules for transferring parole from one state to another (called ‚Äúinterstate parole transfer‚Äù).<sup><a href="#footnote-522" id="footnote-ref-522">[522]</a></sup> The Interstate Compact applies in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.<sup><a href="#footnote-523" id="footnote-ref-523">[523]</a></sup> If you are classfied as a sex offender, there are special rules that apply to you in requesting to transfer your parole to a different state (see PG.¬†180).</p>
        <h4>IF YOU ARE currently INCARCERATED:</h4>
        <p>The earliest that California can send an interstate transfer request for you is 120 days before your expected release date (ERD) from prison.<sup><a href="#footnote-524" id="footnote-ref-524">[524]</a></sup> The receiving state is supposed to respond within 45 days of receiving a transfer request.<sup><a href="#footnote-525" id="footnote-ref-525">[525]</a></sup> The process can be sped up in an emergency.<sup><a href="#footnote-526" id="footnote-ref-526">[526]</a></sup></p>
        <h4>IF YOU ARE formerly incarcerated:</h4>
        <p>If you are out and living in the community, you may request to transfer your parole to a new state if you meet basic eligibility requirements. Read about those requirements below, and follow these steps:</p>
        <p><strong>STEP 1: Generally speaking, you must meet the basic eligibility requirements to request to transfer your parole to a different state. The basic requirements are:</strong></p>
        <ol class="text">You have 90 days (3 months) or more, or an undecided amount of time, left to serve on parole at the time your application is submitted to the state you wish to transfer to; </ol>
        <ol class="text">You have a valid supervision plan; </ol>
        <ol class="text">You have not had parole revoked and have no pending parole revocation charges; AND</ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>EITHER</em> You are a resident of the receiving state <em>OR</em> You have family that lives in the state who is willing and able to assist you, and you can obtain employment or have another means of supporting yourself;<sup><a href="#footnote-527" id="footnote-ref-527">[527]</a></sup> AND</ol>
        <ol class="text">You have paid off your restitution orders in California, unless a judge finds that releasing you to transfer parole to another state would be ‚Äúin the interests of justice.‚Äù<sup><a href="#footnote-528" id="footnote-ref-528">[528]</a></sup></ol>
        <p><em>NOTE: Technically, if you do not meet these requirements, California and the state you wish to transfer to may still agree to transfer your parole if there is a very good reason (‚Äúgood cause‚Äù) to do so.</em><sup><a href="#footnote-529" id="footnote-ref-529">[529]</a></sup></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 2: Request the transfer. If you meet the eligibility requirements above, you must request a transfer verbally or in writing from your parole agent. Again, we suggest making a written request to have a paper trail, and making a copy of your request and keeping it in a safe place. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 3: Your parole agent determines whether or not you meet the basic eligibility requirements. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 4: Your parole agent must submit a Transfer Request to CDCR‚Äôs California Interstate Compact Unit in Sacramento, CA for review.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 5: If California approves the transfer, it will be sent to the receiving state for review. It is then up to the state you wish to transfer to whether or not to accept you for parole supervision.</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-530" id="footnote-ref-530">[530]</a></sup></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 6: If approved by both California AND the state you wish to transfer to, you will then be transferred.</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-531" id="footnote-ref-531">[531]</a></sup></p>
        <h4>SPEC<a id="sexoffenderstatetransferrule"></a>IAL RULES FOR SEX OFFENDERS to TRANSFER PAROLE TO NEW STATE:</h4>
        <p>In addition to the rules laid out above, there are additional special rules for transferring states if you are registered as a Sex Offenders.<sup><a href="#footnote-532" id="footnote-ref-532">[532]</a></sup></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 1: To get the process started, you should talk to your correctional counselor (if you are still incarcerated) or your parole agent (if you are out on parole). </strong></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 2: The parole agent should determine whether you meet the eligibility requirements. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 3: If the requirements are met, the parole agent should submit a transfer application to the CDCR‚Äôs Interstate Compact Unit in Sacramento, CA.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>STEP 4: If the CDCR approves the transfer application, the request will be sent to the receiving state.</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-533" id="footnote-ref-533">[533]</a></sup><strong> </strong></p>
