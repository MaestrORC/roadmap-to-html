              <h1>Can an employer consider my credit history?</h1>
              <p class="text">Generally, no. Employers CANNOT look at your credit report unless you are applying for certain high level or sensitive job positions, such as a manager or supervisor within a company, a law enforcement officer, or a position with access to large amounts of cash and/or sensitive financial information.<sup><a href="#footnote-1875" id="footnote-ref-1875">[1875]</a></sup> If you have further questions about your credit history, contact a local legal service organization or call 2-1-1.</p>
              <h4 class="sidebox"><em>Know Your Rights:</em> Convictions More Than 7 Years Old</h4>
              <p class="sidebox">There is a weird gap in the law that you should know about. While employers CAN ask about and consider convictions older than 7 years old  (but only after they have extended a conditional offer of employment), private background check companies CANNOT report information about convictions more than 7 years old on your background check report. This CANNOT come up in a background check.<strong> </strong></p>
              <h4 class="textbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTSYour Rights If An Employer Runs A Background Check</h4>
              <ul class="textbox">Most employers with five or more employees MUST wait to run a background check until they have extended a conditional offer of employment.Employers MUST NOTIFY you and get your PERMISSION BEFORE running a background check on you through a private background check company.Employers MUST offer you a copy of the background check report. ALWAYS request a copy of the background check report.Employers CAN see: convictions and pending (unresolved) arrests, charges, or cases; other personal information about you. But they CANNOT see convictions and other negative information that is more than 7 years old.In general, employers CANNOT see: arrests that did not lead to conviction; convictions that have been dismissed/expunged/sealed; participation in court diversion programs; and certain minor marijuana convictions; your RAP sheet; your credit report.If an employer decides not to hire you because of information in your background check report, the employer MUST NOTIFY you beforehand; give you a COPY of the background check report; and give you a chance to CORRECT any errors in your background check report and/or OFFER proof of rehabilitation or other relevant evidence.</ul>
