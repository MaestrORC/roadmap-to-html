              <p class="text">This section will explain your rights when an employer runs a background check on you or asks you about your criminal record, and what you can do if the employer violates your rights. </p>
              <p class="text">The next section will explain your rights when a background check company produces a report on you, and what you can do if the background check company violates your rights (see <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_584">PG. 584</a>). </p>
              <h4 class="sidebox">HOW COMMON ARE BACKGROUND CHECKS?</h4>
              <p class="sidebox">About 69% of employers run criminal history background checks on all job applicants. About 86% of employers conduct background checks on at least some applicants. Larger companies tend to run routine background on everyone as part of their regular job application process, while smaller companies might not.</p>
