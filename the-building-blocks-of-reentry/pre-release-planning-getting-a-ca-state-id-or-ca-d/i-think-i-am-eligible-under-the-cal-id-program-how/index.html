        <h1>I think I am eligible under the CAL-ID program. How do I apply?</h1>
        <p class="text">If you want to apply for a CA State ID card through the CAL-ID program, talk to your correctional counselor (also called a ‚ÄúCC I‚Äù) at the prison.<strong> </strong><sup><a href="#footnote-65" id="footnote-ref-65">[65]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text">CDCR has informed us that the screening process takes place during the Release Program Study (RPS) (read more about the RPS on PG.¬†147), which is usually performed 120-240 days prior to the prisoner‚Äôs release. CDCR has also informed us that a Parole Services Associate (PSA) collects the CAL-ID applications, sends them to CDCR headquarters, and monitors each prisoner‚Äôs progress in the CAL-ID program using an electronic tracking log.</p>
        <p class="text">As your release date approaches, you should be meeting with your counselor to develop a reentry plan. If you‚Äôre eligible for the CAL-ID program, your counselor should help you fill out the application for a CA State ID. If your counselor has not mentioned the program, and you think you are eligible, you should bring it to your counselor‚Äôs attention. The prison staff will check that all of your information is accurate, and then send your application to the CAL-ID Coordinator‚Äôs office at CDCR, which then shares it with the DMV.</p>
        <p class="text">If the DMV finds that you are eligible, it will send your new CA State ID directly to the prison. The prison will hold the ID in your file and give it to you at the time you are released. NOTE: It‚Äôs possible your CA State ID card won‚Äôt arrive in time before your release‚Äîfor example, if your release date is recalculated so that you get out earlier than expected. In this case, once your CA State ID card is ready, the prison will send it to your address in the community, or (if you‚Äôre on parole) send it to your parole officer to give it to you.</p>
        <h4 class="sidebox">OPTIONAL STEPS TO SAVE YOU TIME!</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">(1) Schedule an appointment. Call (1-800-777-0133) or go online (<a href="http://www.dmv.ca.gov">http://www.dmv.ca.gov</a>) ahead of time and request an appointment time to avoid waiting in long DMV lines. Some offices have a back-log of appointments and you might not be able to get one for several weeks. In that case, going in person might be better!(2) Request an application by mail &amp; fill out before you go. You can call the DMV at 1-800-777-0133 to request to have the CA Driver License or ID Card Application (Form DL 44) mailed to you to fill it out at home. Remember, you will still have to go to the DMV office in person to submit the application (you cant do it by mail).</p>
