        <h1>Work Opportunity Tax Credits: What are they & how can they encourage employers to hire me?</h1>
        <p class="text">Suggest that your employer look into the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC). The WOTC is a federal tax credit historically available to employers for hiring job applicants who face significant barriers to employment, including people with felony convictions who are hired within 1 year after their conviction or release from prison, veterans, and recipients of certain public benefits.<sup><a href="#footnote-1833" id="footnote-ref-1833">[1832]</a></sup> (For this reason, be sure to answer truthfully if an employer or job application asks whether you receive public benefits!) The WOTC ranges from $1,200 to $9,600, depending on your hours and pay during your first year as an employee, and on the maximum allowed credit.<sup><a href="#footnote-1834" id="footnote-ref-1834">[1833]</a></sup> For more information about the WOTC in California, contact the WOTC Coordinator at (916) 227-5163, or visit the Employment Development Department’s (EDD) website about the WOTC at: <a href="http://www.edd.ca.gov/jobs_and_training/Work_Opportunity_Tax_Credit.htm">http://www.edd.ca.gov/jobs_and_training/Work_Opportunity_Tax_Credit.htm</a>. </p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Although the legal authority for the WOTC expired on December 31, 2013, tell your employer that he/she should continue to submit WOTC applications to the EDD. In the past, when the WOTC expired, Congress eventually reauthorized the tax credit and applied it retroactively; so it’s recommended that employers continue to submit applications while reauthorization is pending.<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1835" id="footnote-ref-1835">[1834]</a></sup></sup></strong> </p>

        <li id="footnote-1834"><p> See 26 U.S.C. § 51; see also U.S. Dep’t of Labor, WOTC Tax Credit Amounts, <a href="http://Www.Doleta.Gov/Business/Incentives/Opptax/Benefits.Cfm">http://Www.Doleta.Gov/Business/Incentives/Opptax/Benefits.Cfm</a>. Employers may use the “WOTC Calculator” tool available online at: <a href="http://www.doleta.gov/business/incentives/opptax/wotcEmployers.cfm">http://www.doleta.gov/business/incentives/opptax/wotcEmployers.cfm</a>. <a href="#footnote-ref-1834">↑</a></p></li>
        <li id="footnote-1835"><p> See 26 U.S.C. § 51(d)(13)(A)(ii)(II); see also U.S. Dep’t of Labor, Training and Employment Guidance Letter No. 8-13. In the past, Congress has waived the 28-day timeliness rule for applications that were eligible during the program’s lapse period, but there is no guarantee; see IRS, Work Opportunity Tax Credit Extended, <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Expanded-Work-Opportunity-Tax-Credit-Available-for-Hiring-Qualified-Veterans">http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Expanded-Work-Opportunity-Tax-Credit-Available-for-Hiring-Qualified-Veterans</a>. To avoid a denial based on timeliness issues, employers should continue to follow the 28-day rule. California’s WOTC Authorization Center is continuing to process all applications, and expects reauthorization. For more information, see Cal. Emp’t Dev’t Dep’t, Employer Guide, <a href="http://www.edd.ca.gov/jobs_and_training/WOTC_Employer_Guide.htm">http://www.edd.ca.gov/jobs_and_training/WOTC_Employer_Guide.htm</a>. <a href="#footnote-ref-1835">↑</a></p></li>
