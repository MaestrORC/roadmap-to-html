              <h1>How can I find private housing?</h1>
              <p class="text">There are many different ways to find private housing, like an apartment owned by a private landlord. But it is no easy task, especially when your housing needs to be approved by parole or probation, you have special rules to follow in reentry, there is a lack of affordable housing, and discrimination you might be up against. It is important to find support in the housing search!</p>
              <p class="text">Websites like craigslist.com are good places to start—you can search by location, type of housing or apartment, and budget. You can also ask for suggestions from family, friends, or other formerly incarcerated people and mentors who have figured out long-term housing options. Finally, there are some transitional housing programs and reentry programs that provide housing to people with records. You can also search on Google.com for “reentry housing in California” – we found some helpful tips at the following website: <a href="https://www.jobsforfelonshub.com/housing-for-felons/california/">https://www.jobsforfelonshub.com/housing-for-felons/california/</a>.</p>
