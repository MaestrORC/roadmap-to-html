        <h1>I am 26 or older and never registered with the Selective Service. Now i‚Äôm disqualified from certain government benefits and programs. What are my options?</h1>
        <p class="text">It depends on 2 factors‚Äî(1) whether you had good reason for not registering and (2) what program or benefit you are applying for.</p>
        <table><tr><td colspan="2"><p><strong>IF YOU DIDN‚ÄôT REGISTER FOR THE SELECTIVE SERVICE BECAUSE . . .</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>. . . You were incarcerated between the ages of 18 and 26</p></td><td><div class="table9">You may be able to prove that you should qualify for the benefits or programs you are trying to get. To do this, you will have to fill out a form requesting a ‚ÄúStatus Information Letter‚Äù from the Selective Service System. (See Appendix¬†J, PG.¬†123.) You will have to list the dates during which you were incarcerated, and attach any documents that show when and where you were incarcerated. If you can prove that you were incarcerated during the relevant time, the Selective Service System will send you an official letter stating that you <em>were not required to register</em>. If you show this letter to the financial aid, federal job training, or federal job office to which you are applying, it can‚Äôt legally deny you benefits because of your Selective Service status.</div></td></tr><tr><td><p>. . . You didn‚Äôt know about the registration requirement, OR mistakenly believed it didn‚Äôt apply to you</p><p>OR <br/>. . . You thought you were already registered, but the Selective Service has no record of your registration</p></td><td><p>You may still be eligible for government benefits if you can prove to the benefit-issuing agency that you did not ‚Äú<em>knowingly or willfully</em>‚Äù fail to register.<sup><a href="#footnote-299" id="footnote-ref-299">[299]</a></sup> The agency handling your case‚ÄîNOT the Selective Service System‚Äîis in charge of deciding whether you have provided enough proof.<sup><a href="#footnote-300" id="footnote-ref-300">[300]</a></sup></p><p>You must send the benefit-issuing agency certain documents as proof. </p><p class="listparagraph">First, you must request a ‚ÄúStatus Information Letter‚Äù (see PG.¬†83) from the Selective Service System, which summarizes your status with the Selective Service.<sup><a href="#footnote-301" id="footnote-ref-301">[301]</a></sup> </p><p class="listparagraph">Then you should send this letter along with a detailed ‚Äúexplanation letter‚Äù explaining in your own words why you didn‚Äôt register.<sup><a href="#footnote-302" id="footnote-ref-302">[302]</a></sup> Your explanation letter should include any information you think might be relevant to the agency‚Äôs decision. This may include information about where you were living from the ages of 18 to 25, whether you thought you were already registered, and/or why you weren‚Äôt aware of the registration requirement.<sup><a href="#footnote-303" id="footnote-ref-303">[303]</a></sup> </p><p class="listparagraph">To present the most persuasive case, you should also include any documentation you have that supports your story.</p></td></tr></table>
