        <h1>I believe I am eligible for a mandatory or discretionary expungement. How do I get one?</h1>
        <p class="text">In most cases, you will need to file papers in court and ask a judge to expunge your conviction. This process is called filing a <em>Petition for Dismissal</em>, and is basically the same for both mandatory and discretionary expungements, with a few small differences. You will need to file the proper forms in the court where you were convicted, and you may have a hearing in front of a judge (especially if you are requesting a discretionary expungement). For a detailed explanation of each step, see APPENDIX K, on PG. 1006. </p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you have convictions from multiple cases, you will need to file a separate petition for each <em>case</em>.</p>
        <h3><a id="Expung_CAExp_HowAutomaticExpung"></a><a id="_Toc352862202"></a>If my conviction is eligible to be expunged automatically, how does this happen? </h3>
        <p class="text">Under the law, certain drug convictions will be expunged from your record <em>automatically</em>, without you having to file a petition in court. This happens in the following 2 situations:</p>
        <ol class="text"> Successful completion of a drug diversion program:<sup><a href="#footnote-3012" id="footnote-ref-3012">[3011]</a></sup> </ol>
        <ol class="text">In some cases, if you were charged with a drug offense, the judge will <em>suspend your sentence</em> so that you can complete <em>drug treatment</em> instead of going to jail. </ol>
        <ol class="text">If the judge suspended your sentence and ordered you to do a drug-treatment program (<em>drug diversion</em>), and you successfully completed the program, your records will be automatically expunged.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>NOTE: This remedy is available ONLY if you were given drug diversion by the court AND you successfully completed all court-ordered requirements. If you did NOT complete your requirements, or you were NOT actually given diversion by the court, then the conviction will still be on your record (even if you completed a drug treatment program on your own).</em></ol>
        <ol class="text">Minor Marijuana Convictions:<sup><a href="#footnote-3013" id="footnote-ref-3013">[3012]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">If you have a minor marijuana conviction on your record, your record will be cleaned <em>automatically</em> if: </ol>
        <ol class="text">Your conviction was for “<em>simple possession</em>” of marijuana; AND</ol>
        <ol class="text">The conviction occurred <em>after January 1, 1976</em>; AND</ol>
        <ol class="text">The conviction is <em>more than 2 years old</em>.</ol>
        <ol class="text">After 2 years, all records relating to your arrest and conviction will be destroyed. You will be able to say that you have NO arrests or convictions for this case.</ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>NOTE: This automatic erasure of minor marijuana convictions is ONLY for convictions related to possession of less than 1 ounce (28.5 grams) of marijuana for personal use. If your conviction was for cultivation, sales, or transportation of marijuana, it will NOT be erased automatically.</em></ol>
        <p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE:</strong> As of January 1, 2011, simple possession of marijuana is no longer a misdemeanor offense; it is now only an infraction.<sup><a href="#footnote-3014" id="footnote-ref-3014">[3013]</a></sup> Although minor marijuana infractions are supposed to be erased automatically just like other minor marijuana (misdemeanor) convictions, in practice, this doesn’t always happen! If you find that your marijuana infraction has NOT been erased from your record, you will need to contact the court clerk at the court that handled your case and ask him or her to (1) correct your criminal record and (2) destroy all arrest and conviction records from your case.</p>
        <h3><a id="Expung_Ques_EarlyReleaseProb_forExpung"></a><a id="_Toc352862203"></a>Because I am still on probation and need to be off to have my conviction expunged, is there anything I can do to get off early? </h3>
        <p class="text">Yes. Under California law, you can ask the judge to release you early from your probation term (called “<em>early discharge</em>”).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3015" id="footnote-ref-3015">[3014]</a></sup></sup> Although courts often sentence people to several years on probation (for example, 3-4 years for a misdemeanor), many people are able to complete all of their probation requirements (all of the things the court has ordered them to do—such as attend counseling or pay restitution) long before their time is up. For this reason, courts are often willing to release people early from their probation. For more information about probation terms and conditions, see the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, on PG. 125.</p>
        <p class="text">You can request early release from probation whether you are on <em>informal</em> probation (also called <em>court probation</em>), <em>formal</em> probation, or <em>mandatory supervision</em>. The process is the same for all three.<sup><a href="#footnote-3016" id="footnote-ref-3016">[3015]</a> </sup>However. early release from supervision in order to get your conviction expunged ONLY applies if you are on informal or formal PROBATION or Mandatory Supervision. It does NOT apply if you are on parole or PRCS. Although you CAN get off parole and PRCS early, you still CANNOT get your conviction expunged because you will have served a prison sentence for it. </p>
        <p class="text">For more information about the difference between formal and informal probation, PRCS, and parole, see the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, on PG. 125. For more information about getting released early from PRCS, see PG. 950, or see also the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, on PG. 125.</p>

        <p class="sidebox">Remember, it is recommended that ask a lawyer to help you with your Motion for Early Termination forms. But if you cannot get a lawyer or want to do it on your own, you can find helpful information on the California Courts website:</p>
