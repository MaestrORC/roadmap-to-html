        <h1>How do I find out how much court-ordered debt I owe?</h1>
        <p class="text">Since there are typically three types of debt: restitution, court fines and penalties, and court administrative fees, to find out how much you owe requires you to ask different questions to different people/agencies to make sure you know of all of your debt and to figure out how much you owe. Below three different debt types are discussed as well as debts you may owe if you received traffic tickets as part of your case or if you had tickets prior to being incarcerated. </p>
        <h2 class="subheading"><a id="_Toc448153528"></a>Restitution</h2>
        <p class="text"><em>If you are incarcerated</em>, you should be able to get a copy of your restitution balance sheet from your facility (either a CDCR facility or county jail). Ask your Correctional Counselor if you have any questions about your restitution.<sup><a href="#footnote-2124" id="footnote-ref-2124">[2124]</a></sup> </p>
        <p class="text"><em>If you have just been released</em>, your facility (or the agency it has chosen) will either continue to collect your debt itself or refer your debt out to a private collection agency or the Franchise Tax Board.<sup><a href="#footnote-2125" id="footnote-ref-2125">[2125]</a></sup> You should get a demand notice from whichever agency will continue collecting your restitution debt within 90 days of your release, although there is no set time for this.<sup><a href="#footnote-2126" id="footnote-ref-2126">[2126]</a></sup> </p>
        <h4 class="sidebox">REQUESTING copies of your ORIGINAL SENTENCING ORDERS</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">If you want to see what amounts you were originally ordered to pay, you can request a copy of your sentencing order from the court that sentenced you. HOWEVER, these amounts are the <em>original</em> amounts ordered by the court, and will NOT reflect any payments that you’ve made OR include any interest or fees that have been added since. The order also will NOT show the debts you owe from ANY other cases.</p>
        <p class="text"><em>If you are on parole, probation, or community supervision</em>, talk to your parole agent or probation officer.<sup><a href="#footnote-2127" id="footnote-ref-2127">[2127]</a></sup> They can give you a copy of your balance sheet, which has information about how much you currently owe. </p>
        <p class="text">At any time, you can also find out how much you owe by contacting an Adult Restitution Agent at the CDCR Office of Victim &amp; Survivor Rights &amp; Services Restitution Unit at (877) 256-6877 (toll free). They will be able to tell you your restitution balance and can give you information about what to do while you wait for the collection agency to contact you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2128" id="footnote-ref-2128">[2128]</a></sup> </p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448153529"></a>I haven’t ever received notice that I owe any money for restitution, so I probably don’t, right? </h3>
        <p class="text">Not necessarily. While you <em>should</em> receive notice of your debt, it is possible that you won’t. As we said in the beginning of this Chapter, any number of things may have prevented the notice of your debt from getting to you. Even if you have received a demand notice, it is possible that the notice you received only covered <em>some</em>, but NOT <em>all</em> of your debts. Remember, your various debts may have been sent to different agencies. For this reason, it is possible that you owe money even if you did NOT receive a notice and it is possible that you owe more money than the notice stated. It is always better to check in order to be safe!</p>
