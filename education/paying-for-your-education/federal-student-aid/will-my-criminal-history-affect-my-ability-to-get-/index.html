        <h1>Will my criminal history affect my ability to get federal student aid?</h1>
        <p class="text">Maybe. It depends on the circumstances of your offense, the type of aid you are applying for, and your incarceration status.<sup><a href="#footnote-2882" id="footnote-ref-2882">[2881]</a></sup> The following is a summary of the possible implications of a criminal record on your federal student aid eligibility.</p>
        <p class="text"><strong>Drug Convictions: </strong></p>
        <p class="text">If you were convicted of possession or sale of a controlled substance (felony or misdemeanor) while you were already receiving federal student aid, you will be ineligible to receive federal student aid funds for a specified period of time.<sup><a href="#footnote-2883" id="footnote-ref-2883">[2882]</a></sup> The length of time you are ineligible depends on the type and number these convictions you have, and whether or not you have fulfilled any rehabilitation requirements.<sup><a href="#footnote-2884" id="footnote-ref-2884">[2883]</a></sup> (For detailed information on federal student aid and drug convictions, see Appendix E, PG. 890.)</p>
        <p class="text"><strong>Sex Offense Convictions: </strong></p>
        <p class="text">If you have been convicted of a forcible or non-forcible sex offense and you are subject to an involuntary civil commitment after your incarceration for that offense, you are ineligible to receive a Federal Pell Grant.<sup><a href="#footnote-2885" id="footnote-ref-2885">[2884]</a></sup> However, you are still eligible for other types of federal student aid. </p>
        <p class="text"><strong>Currently Incarcerated:</strong></p>
        <p class="text">Unfortunately, while you are incarcerated, you are directly prohibited from getting certain kinds of federal aid (by law), and indirectly banned from some of the others (by logistics). However, once you are released, most of these restrictions are lifted and you become eligible to receive all forms of federal aid. You can even apply before your release so that your aid will be ready by the time you start school.<sup><a href="#footnote-2886" id="footnote-ref-2886">[2885]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text"><strong>Selective Service:</strong></p>
        <p class="text">You are not eligible for federal or state financial aid if you did not register for the Selective Service, unless you fall into one of the exceptions.<sup><a href="#footnote-2887" id="footnote-ref-2887">[2886]</a></sup> See Pg. 73 to figure out whether you are (or were) required to register; how to register now (if you are between 18 and 25 years old and required to register); and how to request an excuse (in a “Status Information Letter”) for not having registered before (if you are 26 or older, never registered, and do not fall into one of the exceptions). </p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you’re incarcerated, do not fill out the FAFSA unless you know you are going to be released in time to attend school <em>that same year</em>. FAFSA information is only good for one year. (Everyone who applies for federal student aid must complete a new FAFSA every year.) </p>
        <p class="text"><strong>On Parole or Probation </strong></p>
        <p class="text">You are free to apply for all forms of federal student aid, including those you couldn’t get while you were incarcerated. However, the drug and sex offense restrictions still apply (see above).<sup><a href="#footnote-2888" id="footnote-ref-2888">[2887]</a></sup></p>
