        <h1>How do I get a tribal ID card?</h1>
        <p class="text">The process may be slightly different for each tribe, and it depends on whether you are already enrolled with the tribe. PLEASE NOTE: Requests for tribal ID cards no longer go through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), whose California office is based in Sacramento, CA; these requests now go directly to the tribe to which you will be returning. </p>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>If neither you nor your parents enrolled with your tribe, the basic steps for getting a tribal ID card are as follows:</em></strong></p>
        <h4 class="step">First, you need the name of the tribe to which you are returning.The best next step is to call or write your tribe’s enrollment department, and ask if they have enrollment <em>forms</em> and <em>instructions</em>; if so, ask them to send these to you.Send the tribe <em>as many details as possible</em> about your family history and tribal ancestry (and if applicable, use the forms they sent you).</h4>
        <p class="text">You will need to give the tribe as many details about your ancestry as possible — not just your parents’ information, but also information about your grandparents, great-grandparents, great-great grandparents, great-great-great grandparents, and so on. Include information about your family tree and history as far back as you can.</p>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>If you or your parents ARE enrolled with your tribe, the basic steps for getting a tribal ID card are as follows:</em></strong></p>
        <h4 class="step">Contact the tribe’s enrollment department directly, and they will likely be able to assist you in a getting a copy of your tribal ID card.Follow any instructions given to you by the tribe.</h4>
        <p class="text"><em>Note:</em> The process for obtaining a tribal ID card is much easier if you or one of your parents is enrolled in the tribe.</p>
