        <h1>Getting Social Security Card in person</h1>
        <a id="_Toc448152695"></a>
        <h3>I want to get<a id="Replacement_SSC_After_Release_InPerson"></a> a replacement Social Security card in person (which is recommended). How do I do that? </h3>
        <h4 class="sidebox">Not sure if you ever had a ssn?</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">If you‚Äôre not sure if you‚Äôve ever had a SSN, there is unfortunately no easy way to check. There are services that you can pay to check, but it‚Äôs unclear if they are trustworthy. For this situation, we suggest trying to get a replacement card, and seeing if the SSA tells you that there was no original card to replace.</p>
        <h4 class="step">Gather the documents you will need to show proof of your identity. </h4>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>Proof of identity</em></strong><a id="SSC_Proof_of_Identity_Docs"></a><em> </em>requires 3 things (which you may be able to show all in one document):<sup><a href="#footnote-47" id="footnote-ref-47">[47]</a></sup></p>
        <ol class="text">Proof of your age;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Proof of your citizenship or legal presence in the U.S.;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Proof that you are still alive. </ol>
        <p class="text">As mentioned, you may only need to show one ‚Äúprimary‚Äù ID document in order to get a replacement Social Security Card<sup><a href="#footnote-48" id="footnote-ref-48">[48]</a></sup> because a ‚Äúprimary‚Äù ID document can prove all 3 of these things by itself. Primary ID documents that are accepted to prove your identity for a replacement Social Security Card are:</p>
        <ol class="text">U.S. state-issued Driver License;</ol>
        <ol class="text">U.S. state-issued ID Card;</ol>
        <ol class="text">U.S. Passport.<sup><a href="#footnote-49" id="footnote-ref-49">[49]</a></sup></ol>
        <p class="text">Any documents you submit to establish your identity must show your legal name AND provide biographical information (your date of birth, age, or parents‚Äô names) and/or physical information (a photograph or physical description‚Äîheight, eye and hair color, etc.). Generally, ID documents without an expiration date should have been issued within the past 2 years.<sup><a href="#footnote-50" id="footnote-ref-50">[50]</a></sup> If you don‚Äôt have any of these documents, see:</p>
        <h4 class="step">Find your local Social Security Administration Field Office or Card Center. </h4>
        <p class="text">Search online at <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov">http://www.socialsecurity.gov</a> or call the Social Security Administration (SSA) at 1-800-772-1213.</p>
        <h4 class="step">Go to your local SSA Field Office or Card Center and fill out the application.Meet with an SSA employee to verify your identity. </h4>
        <p class="text">Remember, the SSA agent is going to evaluate the evidence you bring in and make a judgment call as to who you are. While none of the documents you may have might be enough alone to prove your identity, if you are there in person with as much identifying documentation as possible, everything combined will hopefully be enough to prove your identity.</p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: HERE IS HOW TO GET A SOCIAL SECURITY CARD WHEN YOU DON‚ÄôT HAVE THE PRIMARY ID YOU NEED: If you have been incarcerated for a long time, or were incarcerated when you were young, chances are you never had one of these primary ID documents, or the government took it and destroyed it long ago. Unfortunately, the SSA writes these rules for the general public‚Äîfor people who still have valid and current primary ID documents and can easily replace their Social Security Card. Even if you do not have primary ID documents, you may still be able to get a replacement Social Security Card. Gather as much identifying information and documentation as you can to include with your application. Then, on a case-by-case basis, the SSA gets to decide whether or not you have sufficiently proven who you are.<em>IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A PRIMARY ID DOCUMENT, USE AS MANY OF THE FOLLOWING AS YOU HAVE:</em></p>
        <ul class="importantbox">Authorized Birth Certificate‚ÄîWithout a primary ID document, your birth certificate will be the most important document you submit. But the birth certificate alone is not enough to show proof of your identity. This is because the SSA still needs proof that the person named on the birth certificate is alive and that you are that person!<a id="MOUs_SSA_otherproofofidentity"></a>Other proof of identity‚ÄîThe more evidence of your identity that you can provide, the better. Any ID with your picture and name on it, even if it is not government-issued, will make it easier to prove who you are to the SSA. Other proof you can consider are: an employee ID; a school ID; a library card; a Prison ID card, a U.S. Military ID; a health insurance or Medicaid/Medi-Cal card (not Medicare); or a certified copy of your medical record from a health clinic, doctor, or hospital that treated you.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-51" id="footnote-ref-51">[51]</a></sup></sup> The SSA employees are instructed to consider each applicant‚Äôs situation on a case-by-case basis, and all of the evidence presented. </ul>
