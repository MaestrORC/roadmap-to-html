        <h1>I have a prison or jail ID. Is that enough to identify myself?</h1>
        <p class="text">You may already have a prison or jail ID card, but these generally are not enough to help you prove who you are in <em>all the places</em> where you will need an official ID. In the early days of your reentry, though, a prison or jail ID card may help you get other forms of ID. </p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352860858"></a>What are the most important forms of ID to have? </h3>
        <h4 class="sidebox">NATURALIZED U.S. CITIZEN?</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">If you were born outside the U.S. and then became a citizen through the naturalization process, instead of a birth certificate, you need your <strong>naturalization certificate</strong>. For details, go to PG. 36.</p>
        <p class="text">As you rebuild your life in the community, there are 3 KEY DOCUMENTS for you to have: (1) your <strong>birth certificate</strong>; (2) your <strong>Social Security card (or number)</strong>; and (3) a <strong>state ID or driver license</strong> (you don't need both, just one). </p>
        <p class="text">Once you have your birth certificate and Social Security number (SSN), you will be able to get a California state ID card or a driver license, the most commonly used forms of ID for everyday purposes. Once in a while, you will need to show a copy of your Social Security card for certain services, just knowing your Social Security number (SSN) is enough (without presenting the actual card).</p>
