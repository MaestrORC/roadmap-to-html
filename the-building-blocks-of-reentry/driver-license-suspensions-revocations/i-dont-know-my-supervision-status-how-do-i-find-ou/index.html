        <h1>I don‚Äôt know my supervision status. How do I find out?</h1>
        <p class="text">It is very common to not know what kind of supervision you are on! If you are unaware or unsure of what your supervision status is, you should talk to your supervising officer or your public defender to find out what category you fall into. Tell them you are trying to determine if you are eligible to vote. You can even show them this chart to help figure out what classification you are in! </p>
        <p class="text"><strong>It‚Äôs also possible that you are on multiple forms of supervision.</strong> If you are on more than one type of supervision and either one prevents you from voting, then you <em>cannot</em> vote. In other words, if you look at the chart‚Äîboth of your supervision status categories must say ‚Äúyes;‚Äù if one says ‚Äúno,‚Äù you cannot vote.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448152741"></a>What if I voted in an election that I was not legally allowed to vote in? </h3>
        <p class="text">It depends. If you ACCIDENTALLY voted in an election that you were not allowed to vote in, you will probably not be in trouble with the law. Voter fraud requires ‚Äúspecific intent.‚Äù<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-247" id="footnote-ref-247">[247]</a></sup></sup> This means that you had to have meant to vote in an election, knowing that you were not allowed to vote and with the purpose of voting even though you knew you were not supposed to vote.</p>
        <p class="text">If you PURPOSEFULLY voted in an election, knowing you were not supposed to vote, you could be found guilty of voter fraud.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-248" id="footnote-ref-248">[248]</a></sup></sup> While majority of the voter fraud crimes are prosecuted when committed on the large scale to impact elections, the punishment can be up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-249" id="footnote-ref-249">[249]</a></sup></sup></p>

        <a id="_Toc448152742"></a>
        <h2 class="subheading">Registering to Vote in CA: </h2>
        <h4 class="sidebox">PRISON IDs:CAN I USE MY PRISON ID AS IDENTIFICATION WHEN I GO TO VOTE?</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">Although a prison ID isn‚Äôt explicitly listed as acceptable ID, the law does allow a ‚Äúdocument issued by a government agency‚Äù to prove who you are. (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 2, ¬ß¬†20107(d)(2)(E).) Because your prison ID was issued by the California Department of Corrections &amp; Rehabilitation (CDCR), which is a government agency, it <em>should be </em>an acceptable form of ID. Keep in mind though that the people who work at the polling stations are volunteers and not experts in California law, so you may need to speak with a few different people if you are having difficulties. Remember: you won‚Äôt need your prison ID card at all if you were able to provide a SSN, Driver License number, or State ID number when you registered.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448152743"></a>I want to vote in the next election. When is the last day I can register to vote in California? </h3>
        <p class="text">The deadline to register is 15 days <em>before</em> the next local, state, or federal election. You must submit the voter registration application form before Midnight on the deadline.</p>
        <ol class="text">If you register using the online form, the timestamp must be before midnight on the deadline date (by 11:59 p.m.).</ol>
        <ol class="text">If you register using a paper form, it must be postmarked or hand-delivered to your county elections office at least 15 days before the election. (See PG.¬†76 to learn how to find your county elections office).<sup><a href="#footnote-250" id="footnote-ref-250">[250]</a></sup></ol>
