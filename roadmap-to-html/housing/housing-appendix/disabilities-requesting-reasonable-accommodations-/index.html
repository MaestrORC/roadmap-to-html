              <h1>Disabilities & Requesting Reasonable Accommodations on Any Housing Application</h1>
              <div class="questionheading">AS SOMEONE APPLYING FOR HOUSING (PRIVATE OR GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED), WHAT DO MY DISABILITIES HAVE TO DO WITH MY CRIMINAL RECORD?</div>
              <p class="text">If you can prove that your criminal conviction was <em>the result of a disability</em>—for example, due to mental illness and/or past drug addiction you may be able to get a “reasonable accommodation” when applying for ANY type of housing. However, a PHA, owner, or other housing provider is not required to grant a reasonable accommodation to an individual with a disability <em>if that person would be a “direct threat” to the health, safety or property of others,</em> unless the requested reasonable accommodations can actually <em>eliminate or significantly reduce such a threat</em>.<em> </em></p>
              <p class="text">Under the law, housing providers cannot treat persons with disabilities exactly the same as other housing applicants or residents if doing so denies people with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.<sup><a href="#footnote-1382" id="footnote-ref-1382">[1382]</a></sup> Therefore, by law, a PHA or owner <em>must</em> make reasonable accommodations to its <em>rules, policies, practices, or services </em>when it may be necessary to provide applicants with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a living space<sup><a href="#footnote-1383" id="footnote-ref-1383">[1383]</a></sup>—<em>even if</em> that accommodation results in a preference for disabled individuals over similar, non-disabled individuals.<sup><a href="#footnote-1384" id="footnote-ref-1384">[1384]</a></sup><em> </em>This rule applies to ALL types of housing—public and private. </p>
              <p class="importantbox">WARNING: Just because you committed a criminal offense as a result of a disability does not mean you automatically have the right to a reasonable accommodation for housing. It can be very difficult to prove that your disability CAUSED your criminal offense, AND that the disability is the type that qualifies you for a reasonable accommodation</p>
              <p>!</p>
              <div class="questionheading"><a id="Disability"></a>IF MY CRIMINAL CONVICTION WAS THE RESULT OF A DISABILITY, WHAT IS A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION THAT I CAN ASK FOR?</div>
              <p class="text">A “reasonable accommodation” is a <em>change, exception, or adjustment</em> to a rule, policy, practice, or service that may be necessary to give an applicant with a disability an <em>equal opportunity to use and enjoy a living space</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-1385" id="footnote-ref-1385">[1385]</a></sup> There is no limit or restriction to the type of accommodation that you can request, as long as the accommodation is <em>reasonable</em>. As a general rule, an accommodation will be considered <em>reasonable </em>so long as it does NOT:</p>
              <ol class="text">Pose an undue financial burden on the PHA or owner, and/or</ol>
              <ol class="text">Require the PHA or owner to fundamentally change its housing program<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1386" id="footnote-ref-1386">[1386]</a></sup></span></ol>
              <p class="text">It’s recommended that you ask a Public Housing Authority (PHA), owner, or housing provider to look at your criminal record using a different standard, or to make an exception to its criminal history policy altogether as a reasonable accommodation. Keep reading to learn about approaches for asking your PHA or landlord for a reasonable accommodation.</p>
              <div class="questionheading">WHAT IS CONSIDERED A DISABILITY IN CALIFORNIA? </div>
              <p class="text">California law defines a disability as any <em>physical </em>or <em>mental</em> impairment that limits one or more of your <em>major life activities</em>.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1387" id="footnote-ref-1387">[1387]</a></sup></span> </p>
              <p class="text">&gt; What is a <strong><em>physical disability</em></strong> under California state law?</p>
              <p class="answer">A physical impairment is any disease, physical disorder, physical condition, or disfigurement that:</p>
              <ol class="text">Affects one or more of your body systems (i.e. your heart, your eyes) or functions (i.e. breathing, speaking), and </ol>
              <ol class="text">Limits a <em>major life activity.</em><span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1388" id="footnote-ref-1388">[1388]</a></sup></span></ol>
              <p class="text">&gt; What is considered a <strong><em>mental impairment</em></strong> under California state law?</p>
              <p class="text">A mental impairment<em> </em>is any mental or psychological condition that limits a <em>major life activity</em>. Common examples of mental impairments are: intellectual disabilities; brain disease; emotional or mental illnesses; learning disabilities; and any other mental or psychological condition that requires special attention or services<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1389" id="footnote-ref-1389">[1389]</a></sup></span> </p>
              <div class="questionheading">WHAT IS NOT CONSIDERED A DISABILITY IN CALIFORNIA?</div>
              <p class="text">It is not a protected disability if you are:</p>
              <ol class="text">Currently engaged in illegal drug use;</ol>
              <ol class="text">Currently abusing alcohol in a way that interferes with others’ health, safety, or peaceful enjoyment of the property;</ol>
              <ol class="text">People who pose a substantial threat to others, that cannot be controlled by a reasonable accommodation (see below for more information on reasonable accommodations)<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1390" id="footnote-ref-1390">[1390]</a></sup></span> </ol>
              <div class="questionheading">DOES DRUG ADDICTION QUALIFY AS A DISABILITY?</div>
              <p class="text">Technically, yes, if it is <em>PAST</em> drug use and you have permanently stopped using illegal drugs, it does qualify as a disability under both federal and state law. BUT If you are <em>currently using illegal drugs, then you are not considered disabled</em>.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1391" id="footnote-ref-1391">[1391]</a></sup></span> See the next question for what is considered a disability in California.</p>
              <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! There are no reported California cases where a rehabilitated applicant with a history of substance abuse, or an applicant with mental impairment, and a history of criminal acts arising from the substance abuse or mental illness has been granted a reasonable accommodation from a PHA’s criminal activity restrictions. Courts have generally been unreceptive to these arguments. Specifically, courts have been hesitant to accept arguments that a housing applicant’s criminal convictions were the result of mental illness and/or past substance abuse. Again, since it may be difficult to prove that your criminal conviction was the result of your mental illness and/or drug addiction, it is important that you offer as much evidence as possible. </p>
              <p>!</p>
              <div class="questionheading">HOW can I PROVE MY PAST DRUG USE QUALIFIES AS A DISABILITY?</div>
              <h4 class="sidebox">REMEMBER: </h4>
              <p class="sidebox">It may be difficult to prove that your criminal conviction was the result of your mental illness and/or drug addiction. It is important that you submit as much evidence as possible!</p>
              <p class="text">Under this rule, it can be tricky to prove that you are not a current illegal drug user, especially if there was drug use or convictions for drug use in your recent past. <a id="Recent_drug_use_housing"></a>The law doesn’t clearly define what counts as “current” illegal drug use, and there are no reported California court decisions defining “current” illegal drug use.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1392" id="footnote-ref-1392">[1392]</a></sup></span> Some courts outside of California have said a person is NOT a current illegal drug user if that person has <em>permanently stopped using illegal drugs</em> for periods of time ranging from a few months to a year.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1393" id="footnote-ref-1393">[1393]</a></sup></span> Outside of California, courts have said that someone is still a “current” user if they have stopped using for only a few weeks.<sup><a href="#footnote-1394" id="footnote-ref-1394">[1394]</a></sup></p>
              <p class="text">Based on the different ways courts are treating this issue, we recommend that you <em>provide evidence</em> that you are <em>not a current user</em> by showing any proof that:</p>
              <ol class="text">You have successfully completed a supervised substance abuse/drug rehabilitation program;</ol>
              <ol class="text">You are not currently using illegal drugs (meaning any proof that you have permanently stopped using illegal drugs); and/or</ol>
              <ol class="text">You are currently participating in a supervised substance abuse/drug rehabilitation, treatment, or self-help program<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1395" id="footnote-ref-1395">[1395]</a></sup></span></ol>

              <p class="text">Send a <em>written letter</em> requesting a reasonable accommodation to the PHA, housing provider, or owner (the one making the decision) that clearly explains <em>ALL</em> of the following:</p>
              <h4 class="sidebox">EXAMPLES OF REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS INCLUDE:</h4>
              <ul class="sidebox">An exception (“a waiver”) to a PHA, owner, or housing provider’s policy that bars housing to applicants with criminal records, if your criminal conviction was caused by your disability;An owner or housing provider agreeing to admit a tenant with a mental illness that causes the tenant to sometimes become loud or confrontational, so long as the tenant agrees to seek treatment for his or her mental illness;An owner or housing provider allowing a tenant suffering from mental illness to have a live-in aid; orA PHA, owner, or housing provider accepting a reference from an applicant’s social worker or service provider if an applicant has no recent rental history.</ul>
              <ol class="text">That you have a disability, and what that disability is.</ol>
              <ol class="text">That the disability caused the offense. Attach as much documentation as you can. For example:</ol>
              <ol class="text">Letters from service providers showing that you experienced a mental illness and/or a drug addiction at the time of the offense; or even better, a letter from a doctor confirming the existence of your disability;<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1396" id="footnote-ref-1396">[1396]</a></sup></span></ol>
              <ol class="text">If it is addiction, explain that you no longer suffer from addiction. Attach any documentation you have, such as letters from service providers showing successful completion of a rehabilitation program or effective or ongoing treatment for your addiction; and/or letters from service providers that show you are no longer using substances.</ol>
              <ol class="text">What your requested accommodation is, clearly stated:</ol>
              <ol class="text">Ask for what you want directly!! You could ask a PHA, owner, or housing provider to look at your criminal record using a different standard, or to make an exception to its criminal history policy altogether.</ol>
              <ol class="text"><a id="Step4_reasonable_accomodations"></a>Why the accommodation you are requesting is NECESSARY and REASONABLE.:</ol>
              <ol class="text">Here, you should say that <em>an exception</em> from criminal history policy is NECESSARY to give you an <em>equal opportunity to access the housing</em>.</ol>
              <ol class="text">Explain how your criminal conduct <em>was the result</em> of the disability —showing the <em>relationship</em> (also called a “nexus”) between your disability and your requested accommodation.<sup><a href="#footnote-1397" id="footnote-ref-1397">[1397]</a></sup></ol>
              <ol class="text">It is more persuasive if you have a doctor or service provider submit a letter explaining why your disability requires a reasonable accommodation.</ol>
              <ol class="text">You must also show that the requested accommodation is<em> </em>REASONABLE. A requested accommodation may be found reasonable if:</ol>
              <ol class="text">It’s necessary for you to have an equal opportunity to enjoy the living space.</ol>
              <ol class="text">It’s not too expensive for the landlord.</ol>
              <ol class="text">The administrative burden is not too great.</ol>
              <ol class="text">It doesn’t fundamentally change the PHA’s, housing provider’s, or owner/landlord’s operations.</ol>
              <ol class="text">A landlord or PHA accommodation that gives you “preference” over similar non-disabled people <em>may be reasonable under the circumstances</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-1398" id="footnote-ref-1398">[1398]</a></sup></ol>
              <p class="textbox"><strong>“THE DIRECT THREAT EXCEPTION:”</strong> Remember that the law <em>does not require</em> that reasonable accommodations be granted to an individual with a disability if that person would be a “direct threat” to the health or safety of other individuals or if that person’s residency would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others <em>UNLESS </em>the reasonable accommodations requested can actually <em>eliminate or significantly reduce such a threat</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-1399" id="footnote-ref-1399">[1399]</a></sup><em> </em>This is known as the “direct threat” exception. <strong>You have some protections if the PHA, housing provider, or landlord is arguing you are a “direct threat”:</strong></p>
              <ul class="textbox">First, a PHA or owner MUST PERFORM an <em>individualized assessment</em> of you.Second, if a reasonable accommodation can significantly reduce the “direct threat” posed by a recognized disability, then the PHA, housing provider, or owner <em>must</em> make it.Third, if the PHA, housing provider, or owner finds that you pose a direct threat to other tenants or property, this should be based o<em>nly</em> on actual examples of you causing harm or other factual, objective evidence—not their own fears or assumptions about what <em>could</em> happen.Fourth, a finding of a direct threat cannot be based on assumptions, stereotypes, or fears about mental illness, drug addiction, or other disabilities.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1400" id="footnote-ref-1400">[1400]</a></sup></span></ul>
              <div class="questionheading">ONCE I have SENT MY REQUEST FOR A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION, what happens?</div>
              <p class="text">There are several phases of a reasonable accommodation request:<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1401" id="footnote-ref-1401">[1401]</a></sup></span></p>
              <ol class="text"><strong>Initial request</strong> (see <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_421">PG. 421</a>). This is when you first send your letter informing the PHA, owner, or housing provider that you have a disability and are requesting a reasonable accommodation<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1402" id="footnote-ref-1402">[1402]</a></sup></span> </ol>
              <ol class="text"><strong>Verification</strong>: Once you make your initial request for a reasonable accommodation, the PHA, owner, or housing provider will want to verify that you are indeed disabled.</ol>
              <ol class="text">If your disability is obvious or known, and the need for a reasonable accommodation is known, then the housing provider should not ask you for any more information </ol>
              <ol class="text">If your disability is known and obvious, but your need for the accommodation is not well-known or obvious, then the housing provider should ask only for information necessary to verify the need for a reasonable accommodation—for example, notes explaining your need from a doctor or clinician. </ol>
              <ol class="text">If your disability or need for an accommodation is unknown or not obvious, the housing provider may ask for verification of both your disability and your need for a reasonable accommodation.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1403" id="footnote-ref-1403">[1403]</a></sup></span> </ol>
              <ol class="text"><strong>The Decision</strong>. After reviewing your request, the PHA, owner, or housing provider will decide whether or not to grant your reasonable accommodation request. </ol>
              <ol class="text"><strong>The “Interactive” process</strong>:</ol>
              <ol class="text">If the PHA, owner, or housing provider refuses to grant you a reasonable accommodation, you should try to engage them in an informal “interactive process” in which you discuss alternative solutions that might meet both of your needs. HUD guidelines encourage you to try this informal route first, before starting the formal grievance procedure, because it is more flexible and often leads to quicker resolutions.<sup><a href="#footnote-1404" id="footnote-ref-1404">[1404]</a></sup> </ol>
              <ol class="text">If after the “interactive process,” the PHA, owner, or housing provider still refuses to grant you a reasonable accommodation, you may have to file a formal complaint with HUD or DFEH.<sup><a href="#footnote-1405" id="footnote-ref-1405">[1405]</a></sup> </ol>
              <div class="questionheading">HOW can I CHALLENGE MY DENIAL FOR A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION?</div>
              <p class="text"><strong>OPTION 1: YOU CAN FILE A COMPLAINT. </strong>If you believe that a PHA, owner, or housing provider denied your request for a reasonable accommodation due to your disability and/or your past drug use, you may file a complaint with HUD (federal housing protection agency) or with California’s DFEH (the state housing protection agency).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1406" id="footnote-ref-1406">[1406]</a></sup></span> After you file a complaint, if HUD or DFEH determines that you were discriminated against (they find your complaint has “merit”), then HUD or DFEH will file a civil lawsuit against the PHA, owner, or housing provider on your behalf. Go to Appendix I on <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_430">PG. 430</a> to learn how to file a complaint with HUD or DFEH.</p>
              <p class="text"><strong>OPTION 2: YOU CAN TRY TO SUE IN COURT.  </strong>To sue a housing provider under the federal Fair Housing Act (FHA), California’s Fair Housing and Employment Act (FEHA), or other state anti-discrimination laws (such as California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act),<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1407" id="footnote-ref-1407">[1407]</a></sup></span> you must show that your status as an individual with a disability or drug history was a <em>motivating factor</em> in the owner’s or PHA’s decision to deny your reasonable accommodation request.<sup><a href="#footnote-1408" id="footnote-ref-1408">[1408]</a></sup> You must also provide sufficient evidence that the requested accommodation is reasonable, and that you are a former/ recovering substance user (and not a current substance user), or that you are receiving treatment for your mental illness.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1409" id="footnote-ref-1409">[1409]</a></sup></span></p>
              <div class="questionheading">WHAT IS THE PHA, OWNER, or landlord LIKELY TO ARGUE TO DEFEND its decision to DENy my REASONABLE ACCOMDATION?</div>
              <p class="text">The PHA or owner will likely argue that you do not have a protected disability.</p>
              <p class="text">They might argue that, you are a “current user” of illegal drugs or substances, and therefore, you are not disabled under the law, OR that you have not sought adequate treatment for your mental illness, and therefore are not disabled under the law.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1410" id="footnote-ref-1410">[1410]</a></sup></span> </p>
              <p class="text">If you go to court, you can attempt to disprove these arguments by providing <em>treatment records</em> establishing that you have not used illegal substances for the relevant period of time, or that you receive treatment for your mental illness.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1411" id="footnote-ref-1411">[1411]</a></sup></span> Your argument will be even stronger if you can provide <em>e</em>vidence of your participation in or completion of a drug/substance abuse treatment program, or proof that you receive treatment for your mental illness.
