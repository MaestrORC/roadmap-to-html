                    <p class="text">Some employers require their employees to be covered under fidelity bonding insurance, which is a special type of insurance that protects the employer from money or property loss caused by employee dishonesty. If your employer requires fidelity bonding insurance, there are two options: (1) private fidelity bonding insurance, and (2) the Federal Bonding Program.</p>
                    <p class="text"><strong><em>(1) Private Bonding Insurance—</em></strong>Many private insurance companies sell fidelity bonding insurance that employers can buy. The insurance will reimburse employers for losses due to things like forgery, theft of money or valuables, or fraud by a company employee. An employer can buy insurance coverage for ALL employees, or for only a few, specific employees.<sup><a href="#footnote-1828" id="footnote-ref-1828">[1828]</a></sup> However, if you already have a criminal conviction record, your employer may not be able to get private bonding insurance for you.<sup><a href="#footnote-1829" id="footnote-ref-1829">[1829]</a></sup> In this case, the employer may be able to get bonding insurance through a special federal government program (see immediately below). </p>
                    <p class="text"><strong><em>(2) Federal Bonding Program—</em></strong>If you already have a criminal conviction record, your employer may not be able to get private bonding insurance for you. If you are applying for a job with an employer who requires employees to be covered by fidelity bonding insurance, the federal government has a special program to provide FREE fidelity bonding insurance for 6 months to cover individuals who are eligible for the program.<sup><a href="#footnote-1830" id="footnote-ref-1830">[1830]</a></sup> In California, the California Employment Development Department (EDD)—the same state agency that runs America’s Job Centers of California—runs the Federal Bonding Program. For more information and instructions on how to apply for the Federal Bonding Program, see Appendix E, <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_619">PG. 619</a>.</p>
                    <h5 class="question">Am I eligible for the Federal Bonding Program?</h5>
                    <p class="text">If you meet the following requirements, you may be eligible for the Federal Bonding Program:</p>
                    <ol class="text">You have a firm job offer (or are already employed) at a job that is likely to be long-term or permanent. </ol>
                    <ol class="text">The job requires you to be bonded, and you cannot get private bonding insurance due to your arrest or conviction record, history of drug or alcohol abuse, poor credit or employment history, dishonorable discharge from the military, or other “risk” factors.</ol>
                    <ol class="text">The employer is ready to hire you (or keep you on the job) once you have insurance, so the only thing stopping you from working there is the lack of insurance.</ol>
                    <ol class="text">You are 18 or older and legally eligible to work in the U.S.</ol>
                    <p class="text">For a complete list of eligibility requirements, see Appendix E, <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_619">PG. 619</a>. </p>
                    <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Your employer can only get free insurance coverage for the first 6 months that you work there; after that they will have to purchase insurance directly. If you switch to another job that also requires bonding, you will have to reapply to the EDD, and they will decide on a case-by-case basis whether you can get new insurance coverage at the new employer. If you left your previous job on good terms, you will have a better chance of getting bonding insurance for your next job, but it is not guaranteed.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1831" id="footnote-ref-1831">[1831]</a></sup></strong> For this reason, it’s recommended that you only use the bonding program for jobs that are likely to be long-term or permanent—NOT for temporary positions.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1832" id="footnote-ref-1832">[1832]</a></sup></strong></p>

                    <p class="text">Suggest that your employer look into the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC). The WOTC is a federal tax credit historically available to employers for hiring job applicants who face significant barriers to employment, including people with felony convictions who are hired within 1 year after their conviction or release from prison, veterans, and recipients of certain public benefits.<sup><a href="#footnote-1833" id="footnote-ref-1833">[1833]</a></sup> (For this reason, be sure to answer truthfully if an employer or job application asks whether you receive public benefits!) The WOTC ranges from $1,200 to $9,600, depending on your hours and pay during your first year as an employee, and on the maximum allowed credit.<sup><a href="#footnote-1834" id="footnote-ref-1834">[1834]</a></sup> For more information about the WOTC in California, contact the WOTC Coordinator at (916) 227-5163, or visit the Employment Development Department’s (EDD) website about the WOTC at: <a href="http://www.edd.ca.gov/jobs_and_training/Work_Opportunity_Tax_Credit.htm">http://www.edd.ca.gov/jobs_and_training/Work_Opportunity_Tax_Credit.htm</a>. </p>
                    <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Although the legal authority for the WOTC expired on December 31, 2013, tell your employer that he/she should continue to submit WOTC applications to the EDD. In the past, when the WOTC expired, Congress eventually reauthorized the tax credit and applied it retroactively; so it’s recommended that employers continue to submit applications while reauthorization is pending.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1835" id="footnote-ref-1835">[1835]</a></sup></strong> </p>

Employers may use the “WOTC Calculator” tool available online at: <a href="http://www.doleta.gov/business/incentives/opptax/wotcEmployers.cfm">http://www.doleta.gov/business/incentives/opptax/wotcEmployers.cfm</a>. <a href="#footnote-ref-1834">↑</a></p></li><li><sup id="footnote-1835">1835</sup><p> See 26 U.S.C. § 51(d)(13)(A)(ii)(II); see also U.S. Dep’t of Labor, Training and Employment Guidance Letter No. 8-13. In the past, Congress has waived the 28-day timeliness rule for applications that were eligible during the program’s lapse period, but there is no guarantee; see IRS, Work Opportunity Tax Credit Extended, <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Expanded-Work-Opportunity-Tax-Credit-Available-for-Hiring-Qualified-Veterans">http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Expanded-Work-Opportunity-Tax-Credit-Available-for-Hiring-Qualified-Veterans</a>. To avoid a denial based on timeliness issues, employers should continue to follow the 28-day rule. California’s WOTC Authorization Center is continuing to process all applications, and expects reauthorization. For more information, see Cal. Emp’t Dev’t Dep’t, Employer Guide, <a href="http://www.edd.ca.gov/jobs_and_training/WOTC_Employer_Guide.htm">http://www.edd.ca.gov/jobs_and_training/WOTC_Employer_Guide.htm</a>. <a href="#footnote-ref-1835">↑</a></p></li></ol>
