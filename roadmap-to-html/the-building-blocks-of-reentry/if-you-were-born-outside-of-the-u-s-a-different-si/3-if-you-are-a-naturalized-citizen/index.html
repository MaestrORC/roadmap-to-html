            <p class="text">If you were not born in the United States, but immigrated here and became a U.S. citizen at some point in your life, you are a naturalized citizen. You should have been issued a <em>Certificate of Naturalization</em> at the time you became a citizen. This is essentially the same as a birth certificate for purposes of obtaining other ID documents.<sup><a href="#footnote-39" id="footnote-ref-39">[38]</a></sup> If your Certificate of Naturalization was lost or destroyed, you can apply for a new one. You will need to fill out an “Application for Replacement Naturalization/Citizenship Document” (Form N-565). You can call the Department of Homeland Security, Citizenship and Immigration Services, National Customer Services Center hotline at 1-800-375-5283 to have the form mailed to you. The form is also available online at <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/n-565">http://www.uscis.gov/n-565</a>.<sup><a href="#footnote-40" id="footnote-ref-40">[39]</a></sup> A copy of the most up-to-date form as of the time of this Guide’s first printing (2015) is at Appendix C, PG. 91.</p>

What is the difference and do I need both?</a></h2>
            <p class="text">If you were born in the U.S., and your birth was reported, the government assigned you a <strong><em>Social Security number (SSN)</em></strong><em>.</em> Your SSN is a 9-digit number that is unique to you. The government uses it primarily to identify you, but also to track your income for tax purposes and to calculate any Social Security benefits you accrue as you work. Also, other institutions—like banks, hospitals, schools, and businesses—will use your SSN as a way to identify you.<sup><a href="#footnote-41" id="footnote-ref-41">[40]</a></sup> </p>
            <p class="text">A <strong><em>Social Security card</em></strong> is a paper card that provides a record of your name and SSN. Social Security cards are issued only by the Social Security Administration of the federal government. Social Security cards are always free.<sup><a href="#footnote-42" id="footnote-ref-42">[41]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text">While there are many circumstances in which you will need to provide your <strong>SSN</strong>, you will only need to show the actual Social Security card in a few limited situations—most commonly, when filling out employment paperwork. <em>For this reason, it is a good idea to memorize your SSN, but store your Social Security card in a safe place and only carry it with you when you know you’ll need it.</em></p>

            <p class="text">Like your birth certificate, your SSN proves who you are. You’ll need to provide your 9-digit SSN to access government services and to apply for jobs, public benefits, housing, a driver license, health care, education programs, and financial aid.<sup><a href="#footnote-43" id="footnote-ref-43">[42]</a></sup> </p>

            <p class="text">If you were assigned a SSN at some point in your life, but you don’t know it now, you need to request a <em>replacement card</em>. This is the only way to get your number because the Social Security Administration (SSA) does not give out Social Security numbers any other way. You can apply for a replacement card by mail or in person at a local SSA Field Office. For more information on getting a replacement card, see PG. 38 if you’re incarcerated, or PG. 39 if you’re out.</p>
