        <h1>Judges, Courts & the “Best Interest of the Child” Legal Standard</h1>
        <h4 class="textbox">What will I learn about judges, courts &amp; the “Best Interest of the Child” Legal Standard?</h4>
        <ul class="learn-bullets">Why the court would be involved in your family matters.How judges use the “best interest of the child” legal standard to make decisions about who can care for or see your child or grandchild.Which factors a judge may consider when making decisions about custody and visitation with your child or grandchild.How past substance abuse could impact your ability to reconnect with your child or grandchild.How cleaning up your criminal record might help you gain custody or reunite with your child.</ul>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352861840"></a>Why would the courts be involved in my family matters? </h3>
        <p class="text">There are so many different reasons that courts get involved in family matters. Examples of when courts get involved include cases of divorce or legal separation; cases about paternity/parentage; disagreements about custody, visitation, or child support; when one or both parents are no longer able to care for a child because they are sick, disabled, incarcerated, or passed away; or the court is supervising a child’s care due to allegations of abuse or neglect.</p>
        <p class="text">In most cases, incarceration will affect your relationship with your family, and the courts may end up getting involved to decide who should have the legal right to make decisions about your child or grandchild, and who should be able to visit or care for your child or grandchild. While you are/were incarcerated, it’s possible that there were changes in your child’s care that had nothing to do with your actual conviction, but the courts got involved either because there was already an open case about the child, someone asked the court to get involved, OR the county’s Child Protective Services (CPS) deemed it necessary for the court to oversee the care of your child because of abuse or neglect allegations.</p>
        <p class="text">If a court case is opened about the care of your child, it is important to know that everything in your criminal record will be available to the judge in that case. But the judge doesn’t look only at your criminal record; s/he looks at your record as one factor among MANY factors about whom is best suited to care for your child, and what is in the child’s “best interest.” To learn about the convictions that may ban you from reunifying with a child, see the chart on PG. 719. To learn more about the factors a judge looks at in making decisions about a child’s care, see the next question!</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc317247479"></a><a id="_Toc352861841"></a><a id="FC_V_whatfactorsjudgecustvisitation"></a>What factors does a judge look at when making a decision about custody and visitation with my child/grandchild? </h3>
        <p class="text"><a id="FC_V_BITC_standard"></a><strong>The Legal Standard: “Best interest of the child”:</strong></p>
        <p class="text">As we stated earlier, when deciding whether to let you <em>see, care for, or make decisions</em> for your child or grandchild, the judge must find that it would be in the <strong>“best interest of the child” </strong>to allow you the contact you desire.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2329" id="footnote-ref-2329">[2328]</a></sup></sup> To make this decision, a judge looks at many parts of a child’s life and relationship with you, as well as the other people in the child’s life.<sup><a href="#footnote-2330" id="footnote-ref-2330">[2329]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text">For the most part, there are no hard and fast rules about what is in a child’s “best interest,” in particular when it comes to considering a parent or caregiver’s criminal record. Certain convictions may ban you from reunifying with your child, and you can learn about those in the chart on PG. 719. But in most cases, the judge will consider <em>many factors</em>.</p>
        <p class="text"><strong>Factors a judge will look at about THE CHILD include, but are not limited to, the child’s:</strong></p>
        <ol class="text">Age; </ol>
        <ol class="text">Health; </ol>
        <ol class="text">School needs; </ol>
        <ol class="text">Relationship with each parent (or caregiver); </ol>
        <ol class="text">Connections at home, school, and in the community; </ol>
        <ol class="text">Each parent’s (or caregiver’s) ability to care for the child; </ol>
        <ol class="text">Any history of family violence or substance abuse by either parent (or caregiver). </ol>
        <div class="textstrongemphasis"><strong><strong>Factors a judge will look at about YOU include, but are not limited to:</strong></strong></div>
        <ol class="text">Whether you’ve had a smooth transition back to the community;</ol>
        <ol class="text">Whether you’ve made reasonable efforts to stay in touch with your child;<sup><a href="#footnote-2331" id="footnote-ref-2331">[2330]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">Your criminal record (to which convictions will make it more difficult or even impossible to reconnect with your child, see the chart on PG. 719);</ol>
        <h4 class="sidebox">Show Your Recovery Success!</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">If you have a history of substance abuse, consider ways you can show that you are on the right path by:(1) Keeping a record of rehab meetings you attend including date and time.(2) Ask for letters of support from your drug counselor or sponsor.(3) Prepare to discuss how you have avoided drugs and stayed clean. You may talk about where you live, whom you are friends with and how those changes have helped to keep you sober and clean.</p>
        <ol class="text">How much <em>contact</em> you currently have (and/or previously had) with your child;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-2332" id="footnote-ref-2332">[2331]</a></sup></sup> </ol>
        <ol class="text">If you have the ability of parents to care for child (money, housing, job, stability, etc.);</ol>
        <ol class="text">How much time you were away from your child while in prison or jail, especially if you were unable to stay in touch with him/her during this period;<sup><a href="#footnote-2333" id="footnote-ref-2333">[2332]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">If you have a history of substance abuse (see the next question);</ol>
        <p class="text">These factors will all go into the judge’s decision about what is in the “best interest of the child,” and your custody and visitation rights as a parent or caregiver.</p>
