        <h1>Do I have any options if I pled “guilty” or “no contest” in a criminal case if I didn’t know the immigration consequences of that decision?</h1>
        <p class="text">Maybe. Both state and federal law require criminal defense lawyers to advise their clients of, and defend against, the immigration consequences of a criminal conviction.<sup> </sup>This means you have <em>the right</em> to receive adequate advice from your criminal defense lawyer about the immigration consequences of your criminal case. The law requires defense lawyers (including public defenders) to ask about their clients’ citizenship status; investigate potential immigration consequences; advise their clients about those immigration consequences; and plea-bargain with an eye toward avoiding them. On the next page, you will find a chart that summarizes situations where immigrants have some options to challenge a plea agreement in their criminal case because you were not adequately advised on the immigration consequences.</p>
        <p class="textbox"><strong><em>“Vacated” </em>–<em> a legal term defined: </em></strong>“Vacate” means to erase, cancel or void. We use it in the chart, so refer back to this definition if you are unclear. But note that if your conviction has been <em>vacated</em>, the District Attorney may be able to prosecute you on the original criminal charges. For all of these, ask you attorney for advice about the best path in your case!</p>
        <p class="text">Because Trump is prioritizing the removal of people involved in the criminal justice system, any options for getting rid of convictions is especially critical at this point. <strong>Consult with an attorney who specializes in criminal and immigration law to find out what makes sense under your particular circumstances. </strong></p>
        <p class="text">This chart summarizes different options for challenging your plea agreement if you did not know or understand the immigration consequences of your conviction. You can share this with your lawyer to help you decide which, if any, are the best options available to you.</p>
