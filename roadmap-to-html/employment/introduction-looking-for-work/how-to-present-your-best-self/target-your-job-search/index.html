              <h4 class="sidebox">What about STARTING YOUR OWN BUSINESS</h4>
              <p class="sidebox">Some people find it more fulfilling to be their own boss. Self-employment can give you more control over the type of work you do, flexibility to make your own decisions, and greater responsibility. Think about your skills, interests, and previous work experience or vocational training. If you think that self-employment may be a good option for you, read the section on “Alternatives to Traditional Employment,” starting on <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_606">PG. 606</a> for more information and helpful resources on starting your own business.</p>

                    <div class="textstrongemphasis"><em>1. Consider the type of job you’re applying for.</em></div>
                    <p class="text">Employers will be more concerned if the job position you are applying for requires you to do work that directly relates to your past convictions. For example, if you’ve been convicted of theft, this may concern an employer who is looking to hire someone to become a manager or cashier at a store. If you can proactively point out that the circumstances of your crime—including the seriousness of the offense and the length of time since it occurred—won’t affect your ability to do the job, an employer is more likely to feel you will be an honest and truthful worker. Also, there may be some types of jobs or occupational licenses that you can’t hold by law, based on your conviction offense. See <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_600">PG. 600</a> for more information about legal restrictions for certain types of jobs.</p>
                    <div class="textstrongemphasis"><em>2. Consider the type of employer you’re applying to. </em></div>
                    <p class="text">Consider the type, size, and management style of the company to which you are applying. As of January 1, 2018, employers with five or more employees cannot ask whether or not you have been convicted of a crime until AFTER they have extended a conditional offer of employment.<sup><a href="#footnote-1851" id="footnote-ref-1851">[1851]</a></sup> If you reach this point in the hiring process, you may have more success with a small business than a larger corporation, since you will have a greater opportunity to speak directly with the owner and explain what happened. Still, remember that even big corporate employers are legally required to do an individualized assessment of how your conviction relates to the position.<sup><a href="#footnote-1852" id="footnote-ref-1852">[1852]</a></sup></p>
                    <h3><a id="_Toc389995855"></a>Are there certain types of jobs I can’t have because of my criminal record?</h3>
                    <p class="text">It’s possible. Before applying for work, you should know that certain jobs have legal restrictions that disqualify people with certain past convictions from working in that position. Also, certain types of jobs require you to have a professional or occupational license from the state, and such licenses have their own legal restrictions and can be difficult to get depending on what’s in your record. For more information on legal restrictions and professional licenses—and how you can become re-eligible to work in some cases—see “Jobs &amp; Professions Your Record Might Exclude You From,” starting on <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_600">PG. 600</a>.</p>
                    <p class="text"><em>Examples of jobs with legal restrictions for certain types of convictions: </em>Airport security screeners; Law enforcement officers; Bank employees; Childcare workers in federal facilities or agencies; Port workers.</p>
                    <p class="text"><em>Examples of jobs that require a professional or occupational license: </em>Barber; Beautician/Cosmetologist; Pharmacist; Nurse; Cemetery / funeral home worker; Real estate agent.</p>
                    <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Most jobs do NOT have legal restrictions. The information here isn’t intended to discourage you, but to help you understand your options and find the job that’s right for you. Also, even if an employer cannot hire you for one type of job based on your record, they may have other types of jobs available that may be a better fit.</p>

                    <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTConsider All Your Job Options </h4>
                    <p class="textbox">As you’re thinking about jobs or looking for work, it can be helpful to think about other work options—alternatives to traditional employment—like starting your own business, joining a worker-run cooperative business, or going through a temp agency. You may decide that one of these alternatives is more exciting, more convenient for your schedule and needs, or just a good way to get your foot in the door with an employer.Here are some other ways of working and earning an income that are different from traditional employment:</p>
