              <h1>If I am on state parole, what law sets the length of my parole?</h1>
              <p class="text">If you are on state parole, the length of your parole period is set by state law<sup><a href="#footnote-383" id="footnote-ref-383">[383]</a></sup> and is based on your <em>commitment offense</em> (the crime you are or were incarcerated for), and <em>the date when the commitment offense occurred</em> (NOT the date you were sentenced or released).<sup><a href="#footnote-384" id="footnote-ref-384">[384]</a></sup> </p>
              <p class="text">In most cases, there is a minimum parole period that can be increased up to a maximum parole period if you commit parole violations.<sup><a href="#footnote-385" id="footnote-ref-385">[385]</a></sup> Because state laws set the minimum and maximum parole term lengths, the date that a person actually gets off parole will be determined by a number of factors. See <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_153">PG. 153</a> for more information. </p>
              <p class="text">There are three discharge dates to know — your <em>controlling</em>, <em>maximum,</em> and <em>presumptive</em> discharge date — that all affect when you can get off parole. And there are a number of factors that interact with those three dates to determine whether you can get off parole earlier or later than expected. See the chart on <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_153">PG. 153</a> below for details about these three discharge dates.</p>
              <p class="text">You can find the parole term lengths in California Penal Code § 3000(b) (for set-length parole terms) and § 3000.1 (for life-long parole terms). For your reference, we have included copies of the current versions of these laws in Appendix F, <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_265">PG. 265</a>. (The California Penal Code is a body of laws that apply to crimes, parole, and other criminal justice system-related laws in California). To look up the discharge dates that apply to you, see Appendix C, <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_261">PG. 261</a> of this chapter.</p>
              <h4 class="textbox">WHAT STOPS THE CLOCK FOR MY LENGTH OF TIME ON PAROLE?</h4>
              <p class="textbox">The clock for your parole period is paused if:(1) YOU GO MISSING: Any time you “abscond” from parole (go missing or fail to report to your parole agent), and any time you are not available for parole supervision, this “stops the clock” and does not count toward the parole period. (2) YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR (SVP) PROCEEDINGS: The parole term is “tolled” (paused) until the SVP proceedings are dismissed or you are discharged from the Department of State Hospitals (DSH).(3) YOU ARE SENT TO COUNTY JAIL (NOT PRISON) FOR A NEW FELONY CONVICTION. If you are sentenced to a county jail term for a new felony conviction, you will stay on parole while serving your jail sentence, but the clock will pause on your parole term. If the jail sentence ends before your controlling discharge date (CDD) (see the chart below), you must report to your parole officer upon release and finish serving your original parole term. But if you are sentenced for a new felony conviction, your parole will just be forgotten about — it isn’t paused, but it no longer matters. </p>

You can only get off on your PDD if you have served parole continuously without disruptions, meaning no violation time, suspensions, or “dead time” for absconding (going missing or failing to report to your parole agent).</p><p>For example, someone might have a 5-year parole length with a Presumptive Discharge Date (PDD) of 3 years. This means that the person is eligible to be discharged after 3 continuous years on parole.</p><div class="textbox8">IMPORTANT! Some people do not have a PDD—meaning certain individuals do not have a date on which they are eligible to get off parole early.<sup><a href="#footnote-389" id="footnote-ref-389">[389]</a></sup></div></td></tr></table>
              <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINT</h4>
              <p class="textbox">In addition to these three very important dates, you can ask your parole agent to recommend that you get off parole even earlier than your presumptive discharge date (PDD) — but this is very hard to achieve. For you to get off parole earlier than your PDD, every level of authority has to agree: the parole agent and his or her supervisor, the Regional Administrator for your parole region, and, the Board of Parole Hearings (BPH) must each approve your early release from parole.To determine your CDD, MDD, and PDD, see Appendix B, <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_259">PG. 259</a>. For a sample worksheet to calculate your own parole discharge date, see Appendix C, <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_261">PG. 261</a>.</p>
