        <h1>General Conditions for Every Person on State Parole</h1>
        <p class="text">The general conditions (rules) that apply to you and ALL people on state parole are the following:<sup><a href="#footnote-400" id="footnote-ref-400">[399]</a></sup></p>
        <ol class="text">Unless other arrangements are approved in writing, you should report to your parole agent on the first working day following your release. </ol>
        <ol class="text">You must inform your parole agent of your residence, employment, education, and/or training. </ol>
        <ol class="text">You must report any change or anticipated change to your residence (the address where you live) before the change.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You must inform your parole agent within 72 hours (3 days) of any change to your employment — including a change in job location, a change in your employer, or getting terminated/fired/laid off from your job. </ol>
        <ol class="text">You must comply with all of your parole agent’s instructions.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You cannot travel more than 50 miles from your residence without your parole agent’s prior approval. If you’re homeless, your residence is any location at which you regularly reside, regardless of how many days or nights you stay there. This means all structures with an identifiable street address, including homeless shelters, vehicles, and motels.<sup><a href="#footnote-401" id="footnote-ref-401">[400]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">You cannot leave your county of residence for more than 48 hours at a time.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You cannot leave California without prior written approval of your parole agent.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You cannot engage in any illegal activities (which includes any activities that would violate any state, federal, county, or municipal law). If you engage in illegal activity, even if you are not convicted of a crime, your parole may be revoked.</ol>
        <ol class="text">If you are arrested for any felony or misdemeanor crime, you must inform your parole agent as soon as possible.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You cannot own, use, possess, or have access to:</ol>
        <ol class="text">Any type of gun or ammunition<sup><a href="#footnote-402" id="footnote-ref-402">[401]</a></sup> </ol>
        <ol class="text">Any weapon;<sup><a href="#footnote-403" id="footnote-ref-403">[402]</a></sup> </ol>
        <ol class="text">Any knife with a blade longer than two inches, except kitchen knives (which must be kept only in the kitchen of your home) and knives related to your employment (which may be used and carried only in connection with your employment); or </ol>
        <ol class="text">A crossbow of any kind.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Because you cannot own or have access to or control of any of these weapons/instruments, if you live with someone who has a gun, weapon, knife, or crossbow in your residence, you must make sure that the other person removes those items from the residence, or at least keeps the items locked in a place to which you don’t have access.</ol>
        <ol class="text">You must waive extradition to the State of California from any other state or the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.). This means that you must give up the right to a formal procedure for returning you to California should you leave the state and get arrested or taken into custody. In other words, you cannot challenge any effort by California to return you to the state.<sup><a href="#footnote-404" id="footnote-ref-404">[403]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">If another jurisdiction (other state) has lodged a “detainer” against you (meaning the other state has ordered that you be held there), you may be released to the custody of that state, which means that California will let that other state take control of your supervision and detention temporarily.<sup><a href="#footnote-405" id="footnote-ref-405">[404]</a></sup> However, if you are released from the other state’s custody before your California state parole would have ended, or if the other state decides not to hold you, you must immediately contact the nearest California state parole office for instructions on reporting to a parole agent.<sup><a href="#footnote-406" id="footnote-ref-406">[405]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">You have almost no rights against searches or seizures by a probation officer, a CDCR agent or officer, or any law enforcement/police officer. <em>See the next question</em> (PG. 154) for<em> more detailed information about searches and seizures while you’re on parole.</em></ol>

        <li id="footnote-402"><p> This includes “any device which a reasonable person would believe to be capable of being used as a gun, or any ammunition which could be used in a gun.” In addition to CDCR Regulations that govern gun and weapon ownership while on parole, it is important for you to know that California law makes it a felony for any ex-felon to own, possess, or have custody or control of any firearm—so this applies even once you are off parole. Federal law also makes it a crime for an ex-felon to possess a firearm or ammunition that has been shipped or transported through interstate or foreign commerce. A certificate of rehabilitation (see PG. 153) does not restore the right to possess a firearm. In some cases, but not all, the right can be restored by a full pardon. <a href="#footnote-ref-402">↑</a></p></li>
        <li id="footnote-403"><p> You may not own, use, posses, or have access to a weapon as defined in state or federal laws, or any device, which a reasonable person would believe to be capable of being used as a weapon. <a href="#footnote-ref-403">↑</a></p></li>
