        <h3>What are other laws &amp; restrictions that apply to me and all people on state parole?</h3>
        <h4 class="sidebox">IMPORTANT VOTING RIGHTS UPDATE!</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">The California Supreme Court has ruled that this voting ban only applies to people incarcerated in state prison (or in jail awaiting to be transferred to state prison to serve their prison sentence) and people on state parole. It does NOT apply to people otherwise incarcerated jail, or to people being supervised by county-level probation, including Mandatory Supervision or Post-Release Community Supervision (PRCS). (<em>See </em>Scott et al. v. Bowen (2015).) This is a brand new ruling that expanded the right to vote to many more people in California! Read more on PG. 74 of the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER.</p>
        <p class="text">Additional laws and restrictions that apply to you and all people on state parole are:</p>
        <ol class="text">YOU CANNOT VOTE — In California elections, people who are on parole (or who are currently incarcerated) are not allowed to vote in any elections.<sup><a href="#footnote-443" id="footnote-ref-443">[443]</a></sup> (To learn more about voting rights in California, go to the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER, PG. 74, to see a chart of who can vote based on the type of supervision they’re on.) In federal elections, the voting eligibility laws in the state where you live determine whether or not you have the right to vote if you have a felony convictions. Since these laws vary from state to state, if you ever move, you should look into the state’s voter requirements.</ol>
        <ol class="text">YOU CANNOT SERVE ON A JURY — If you have a felony conviction on your record, you cannot serve on a jury in California, even after you are off parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-444" id="footnote-ref-444">[444]</a></sup> Unfortunately, that means you will not be able to serve on a jury for the rest of your life if you have a felony on your record.</ol>
        <p><strong>Is there any way to get back my right to serve on a jury?</strong></p>
        <p class="address">Yes. You may be able to reduce the impact of your felony conviction(s), including restoring your right to serve on a jury in California. If you are legally allowed to you may:</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Have your felony reduced to a misdemeanor (since misdemeanors don’t prevent you from serving on a jury in California); or</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Apply for a Cer<a id="certofrehabilitation"></a>tificate of Rehabilitation and a Governor’s Pardon at the same time. If you receive the Governor’s Pardon, you can serve on a jury again.</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Apply directly for a Governor’s Pardon, restoring your right to serve on a jury—and other civil rights—if it is granted.<sup><a href="#footnote-445" id="footnote-ref-445">[445]</a></sup><em>(See the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG. 1029, for more information.)</em></p>
        <ol class="text">YOU CANNOT BE ON PRISON GROUNDS WITHOUT APPROVAL — In California, it is a crime for a former prisoner to be on prison grounds for any reason without prior approval of the warden.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-446" id="footnote-ref-446">[446]</a></sup></sup> To get permission to visit, you must (1) get written approval from your parole officer and send it to the warden, along with a letter requesting the warden’s permission and a visiting questionnaire (CDCR Form 106, see Appendix O, PG. 306).<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-447" id="footnote-ref-447">[447]</a></sup></sup></ol>
        <h4 class="textbox">GENERAL VS. SPECIAL CONDITIONSAside from the general conditions of parole, are there other special conditions that could be imposed on me?</h4>
        <p class="textbox">Yes. There are <em>discretionary</em> special conditions that your parole officer can impose on you if they meet certain legal standards (see PG. 273). There are also <em>mandatory</em> special conditions that are imposed on certain individuals because California state law requires them to be imposed. Continue reading below for special conditions further explained. </p>
        <li id="footnote-443"><p> Cal. Const. art. II, § 4; Cal. Elec. Code § 2150. <a href="#footnote-ref-443">↑</a></p></li>
        <li id="footnote-444"><p> Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 203(a)(5). The California Supreme Court has upheld this restriction. <em>See</em> Rubio v. Superior Court, 24 Cal. 3d 93 (1979) (holding that there is no fundamental right to serve on a jury and that excluding ex-felons from juries does not violate the Equal Protection Clause because the prohibition is rationally related to the state goal of assuring impartial verdicts). <a href="#footnote-ref-444">↑</a></p></li>
