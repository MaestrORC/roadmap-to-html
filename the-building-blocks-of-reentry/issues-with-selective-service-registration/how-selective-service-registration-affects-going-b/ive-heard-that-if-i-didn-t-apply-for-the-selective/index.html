        <h1>I‚Äôve heard that if I didn't apply for the Selective Service when I was younger, it can affect my ability to go back to school now that I am released and in the community? Is that true? What can I do?</h1>
        <p class="text">It‚Äôs true‚Äîif you failed to register for the Selective Service between the ages of 18 to 25 (<em>before</em> your 26th birthday), you are not eligible for state or federal financial aid unless you fall into an exception for registering or had a really good reason for not registering, like being incarcerated the entire time ages 18-25. </p>
        <p class="text">However, even if you weren‚Äôt incarcerated during that entire time period, you still may be able to get financial aid despite not registering if you can prove that your failure to register was <em>unintentional</em>. In other words, you have to prove that you didn‚Äôt fail to register on purpose, even though you knew you were supposed to.<sup><a href="#footnote-305" id="footnote-ref-305">[305]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text">For financial aid purposes, the person in charge of deciding whether you have provided enough proof will often be an employee of your school.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-306" id="footnote-ref-306">[306]</a></sup></sup> You will have to request a ‚ÄúStatus Information Letter‚Äù from the Selective Service System (See Appendix¬†J, on PG.¬†123), then send that letter to the relevant department at your school, along with a letter explaining why you didn‚Äôt register. Learn more about this topic in the EDUCATION CHAPTER, beginning on PG.¬†922.</p>
        <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINT</h4>
        <p class="textbox">The school employee in charge of your case is required to consider ALL information related to your situation‚Äînot just what the Selective Serve System says happened‚Äîso provide as much detail as possible to make your case stronger. This may include information about where you were living from the ages of 18 to 25, whether you thought you were already registered, and/or why you weren‚Äôt aware of the registration requirement.<sup><a href="#footnote-307" id="footnote-ref-307">[307]</a></sup> </p>
        <h2><a id="IX_CONCLUSION"></a><a id="_Toc448152771"></a>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p class="text">If you are in reentry, you have quickly realized how important these various forms of identification (‚ÄúID‚Äù) and other key documents are to rebuilding your life, your identity, and your sense of self.</p>
        <p class="text">To review, the BUILDING BLOCKS OF REENTRY: ID &amp; VOTING CHAPTER covered the following topics:</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Birth Certificate</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Social Security Number (SSN) &amp; Card</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">California State ID, Drivers License, and Municipal ID</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">U.S. Passport</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Library Card</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Voter Registration</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Selective Service Registration</p>
        <p class="text">We hope this Chapter has empowered you to gather the important documents and ID you need to start over strong‚Äîand to better understand the different processes and issues that might come up along the way, so you can plan ahead.</p>
        <p class="text"><em>Another important set of documents‚Äînot covered in this Chapter‚Äîare copies of your criminal records.</em> It is important to know what could show up from your criminal record as you apply for public benefits, programs, housing, and jobs; how to spot and fix errors; and how to get help making your record less visible and less powerful by ‚Äúcleaning‚Äù it up. Criminal records are so important in reentry that we have written an entire chapter of this legal guide dedicated just to them. Go to the UNDERSTANDING &amp; CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORD CHAPTER, beginning on PG.¬†1029, to learn more.</p>
