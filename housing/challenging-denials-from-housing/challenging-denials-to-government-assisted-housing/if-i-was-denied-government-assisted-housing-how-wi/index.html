        <p class="text">If you were denied housing due to <em>information that showed up in your criminal record</em>, then the PHA also MUST give you a copy of the criminal record it used. This will help you to understand why you were denied.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1330" id="footnote-ref-1330">[1329]</a></sup></sup></span></p>
        <p class="text">Furthermore, if you are denied admission to federal government-assisted housing, you have the right to WRITTEN <em>detailed notice of the denial</em>—THIS SHOULD EXPLAIN THE SPECIFIC REASON(S) YOU WERE DENIED!<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1331" id="footnote-ref-1331">[1330]</a></sup></sup> Sometimes, PHAs and owners will give you a general notice just telling you that you were denied, but not the specific conduct or offense that was the basis for the decision. If you get a general notice without the important details, you should ask for the detailed notice—which you have the right to! The PHA or owner of government-assisted housing MUST provide you with a detailed notice by law.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1332" id="footnote-ref-1332">[1331]</a></sup></sup> </p>
