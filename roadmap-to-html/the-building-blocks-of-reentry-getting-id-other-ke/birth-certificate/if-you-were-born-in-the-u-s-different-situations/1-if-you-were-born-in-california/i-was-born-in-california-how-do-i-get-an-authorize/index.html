        <h1>I was born in California. How do I get an authorized copy of my birth certificate?</h1>
        <p class="text">You must go through one of two sources to get your California birth certificate: (1) the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), or (2) the County Recorder’s Office of the county where you were born. Generally, it is easier to go through the County Recorder’s Office, but there are pros and cons to each. See the chart on <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_32">PG. 32</a> to learn details about the pros and cons.</p>
        <p class="widetableintroitalcaps">THIS CHART EXPLAINS THE PROS &amp; CONS OF REQUESTING YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH (CDPH) VS. THE COUNTY RECORDER’S OFFICE.</p>
