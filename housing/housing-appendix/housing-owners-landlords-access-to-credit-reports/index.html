              <h1>Housing Owners’/Landlords’ Access to Credit Reports</h1>
              <div class="questionheading">WHAT IS A CREDIT REPORT?</div>
              <p class="text">Your <em>credit report </em>includes information about creditworthiness, such as your record of paying bills on time. A credit report will show information dating back 7 years (or 10 years in the case of a bankruptcy), including the following</p>
              <ol class="text">history of paying bills and loans on time or record of late payments;</ol>
              <ol class="text">open accounts and level of indebtedness;</ol>
              <ol class="text">collection actions;</ol>
              <ol class="text">bankruptcies or tax liens; and</ol>
              <ol class="text">civil court judgments, including housing-related court actions filed by a previous landlord that may or may not have led to a past eviction.</ol>
              <p class="text">HOWEVER, a credit report does NOT include criminal history information like a tenant report would. </p>
              <h4 class="sidebox">HELPFUL HINT: </h4>
              <p class="sidebox">If you are looking for a rental, it is best to check your credit reports before the PHA or owner does—so you know what they will find. You can go online and order FREE credit reports from the three national credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. If there’s an error, it’s a good idea to file a dispute with the bureau rather than try to explain it at the last minute.</p>
              <div class="questionheading">WHO CAN ACCESS MY CREDIT REPORT?</div>
              <p class="text">Anyone who is evaluating your ability to pay for housing can order your credit report in California. That means that private owners, PHAs, AND owners of government-assisted housing can order a credit report to see if you have good credit and will be a reliable tenant. </p>
              <div class="questionheading">DOES MY CONSISTENTLY PAYING RENT ON TIME IN THE PAST HELP MY CREDIT STANDING?</div>
              <p class="text">Maybe, but most likely not. The companies that collect information about your credit standing are only just beginning to collect this information in a systematized way. </p>
              <p class="text">A credit report will show whether or not you’ve ever been evicted, your ability to pay credit card bills, utility bills, and other bills on time, and any success you’ve had paying back loans.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1412" id="footnote-ref-1412">[1412]</a></sup></span></p>
              <div class="questionheading">CAN SOMEONE FIND OUT ABOUT PAST LATE PAYMENTS ON RENT FROM A CREDIT REPORT?</div>
              <p class="text">Maybe. Generally, late rent payments are not a part of your credit history unless the landlord or management company is reporting them. If the matter was referred to a collection agency or a civil court (like eviction case started against you), it is possible it would show up on your credit report.</p>

              <div class="questionheading">WHAT IS THE SAN FRANCISCO FAIR CHANCE ORDINANCE (SF FCO)? </div>
              <p class="text">The <em>San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance</em> (SF FCO)is a new law that offers special protections for people with criminal records who apply to certain types of affordable housing in San Francisco.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1413" id="footnote-ref-1413">[1413]</a></sup></span> (If you are interested in the parts of this new law that apply to employment, go the EMPLOYMENT CHAPTER, Appendix G, on <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_627">PG. 627</a>.)</p>
              <h4 class="textbox">LOOKING FOR MORE INFORMATION ONLINE?</h4>
              <p class="textbox">Check out the San Francisco Human Rights Commission’s website about how the SF FCO applies to affordable housing providers: <a href="http://sf-hrc.org/sites/sf-hrc.org/files/Fair%20Chance%20Housing%20Notice%20FINAL.pdf">http://sf-hrc.org/sites/sf-hrc.org/files/Fair%20Chance%20Housing%20Notice%20FINAL.pdf</a>. </p>
              <div class="questionheading">WHAT KINDS OF HOUSING DOES THE SAN FRANCISCO FAIR CHANCE ORDINANCE PROTECT?</div>
              <p class="text">It protects applicants and tenants in<em> city-funded affordable housing</em> in San Francisco, California. It does NOT apply to federally subsidized housing (unless the property is receiving multiple subsidies including city-funded subsidies to keep it affordable).</p>
              <div class="questionheading">DOES THE SAN FRANCISCO FAIR CHANCE ORDINANCE APPLY TO federal government-assisted HOUSING?</div>
              <p class="text"><em>No. </em>These new legal protections apply only to <em>city government-funded affordable housing</em> in San Francisco, CA.</p>
              <div class="questionheading">WHAT KIND OF PROTECTIONS DOES THIS LAW GIVE ME IF I’M APPLYING TO CITY-FUNDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN SAN FRANCISCO AND HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD?</div>
              <h4 class="sidebox">IMPORTANT DEFINITION: </h4>
              <p class="sidebox">Under the San Francisco Fair Chance ordinance, <strong>“affordable housing”</strong> is defined as “any residential building in the City that has received funding from the City, connected in whole or in part to restricting rents, the funding being provided either directly or indirectly through funding to another entity that owns, master leases, or develops the building. Affordable Housing also includes ‘affordable units’ in the City as that term is defined in Article 4 of the Planning Code.” The term <strong>“housing provider”</strong> is broad, and includes any entity that owns, master leases, or develops affordable housing, and any agent, such as a property management company, that makes tenancy decisions on behalf if these entities.</p>
              <p class="text">We break down what rights the SF FCO gives you in each step of your application to affordable housing in San Francisco:</p>
              <h4 class="step">Know your rights when applying for affordable housing in San Francisco.</h4>
              <p class="text">When you are APPLYING, Affordable housing providers in San Francisco:</p>
              <ol class="text">MUST NOT have a question about past convictions on the initial application. <em>Before</em> an affordable housing provider asks about your convictions or looks at a background check report on you, it <em>must:</em><span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1414" id="footnote-ref-1414">[1414]</a></sup></span></ol>
              <ol class="text">Determine that you are (1) legally eligible to rent the housing unit <em>and </em>(2) qualified to rent the housing unit under the affordable housing provider’s criteria for evaluating rental history and credit history;</ol>
              <ol class="text">Provide notice about the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance;<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1415" id="footnote-ref-1415">[1415]</a></sup></span> <em>and</em></ol>
              <ol class="text">Provide notice about state and federal laws about background checks.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1416" id="footnote-ref-1416">[1416]</a></sup></span></ol>
              <ol class="text">MUST NOT have blanket bans like “No Felons Apply.”</ol>
              <ol class="text">In ads, they MUST state that they will consider qualified applicants with criminal histories.</ol>
              <ol class="text">They MUST have a notice posted about the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1417" id="footnote-ref-1417">[1417]</a></sup></span> <em>Here is an electronic copy of the notice that affordable housing providers must post:</em> <a href="http://sf-hrc.org/sites/sf-hrc.org/files/Fair%20Chance%20Housing%20Notice%20FINAL.pdfn">http://sf-hrc.org/sites/sf-hrc.org/files/Fair%20Chance%20Housing%20Notice%20FINAL.pdfn</a>. You can also see a copy on Appendix H, <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_427">PG. 427</a>.</ol>
              <h4 class="step">Know you rights when <em>asked</em> about your criminal background.</h4>
              <p class="text"><em>What can city-funded affordable housing providers in San Francisco ask me about my criminal record after they find I am qualified for the housing in every other way? </em></p>
              <p class="text">After you’re found qualified, an affordable housing provider in San Francisco can ask about: pending (open) arrests, and convictions that are 0–7 years old (based on the date of sentencing).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1418" id="footnote-ref-1418">[1418]</a></sup></span> BUT even though they can ask about this information, there are limits on how the affordable housing provider can use it—see <strong>Step 3</strong> below.</p>
              <p class="text"><em>What can city-funded affordable housing providers in San Francisco NEVER ask me about my criminal record?</em></p>
              <p class="text">City-funded housing providers in San Francisco can never ask about:</p>
              <ol class="text">Arrests that didn’t lead to a conviction;</ol>
              <ol class="text">Diversion or deferral programs;</ol>
              <ol class="text">Dismissed convictions (which means any conviction that has been dismissed, expunged, voided, invalidated, or made inoperative by the Court);</ol>
              <ol class="text">Juvenile convictions;</ol>
              <ol class="text">Convictions older than 7 years (based on the date of sentencing);</ol>
              <ol class="text">Infractions (meaning anything that is not a misdemeanor or felony).</ol>
              <ol class="text">Affordable housing providers cannot ask about these 6 types of cases and can never use them against you at any stage!</ol>
              <h4 class="step">Know you rights when being considered for affordable housing in San Francisco.</h4>
              <p class="text">An affordable housing provider in San Francisco that is considering your conviction history <em>must:</em></p>
              <ol class="text">Conduct an individualized assessment—meaning look at all of the circumstances of the person applying to housing and information available about their criminal record, including mitigating circumstances;</ol>
              <ol class="text">Consider only “directly-related” convictions — which means that the underlying conduct “has a direct and specific negative bearing on the safety of persons or property, given the nature of the housing;”<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1419" id="footnote-ref-1419">[1419]</a></sup></span></ol>
              <ol class="text">Consider the time that has passed since your conviction(s); <em>and</em></ol>
              <ol class="text">Consider any evidence of rehabilitation or mitigating information you share, such as:</ol>

              <ol class="text">Participation in an alcohol/drug treatment program;</ol>
              <ol class="text">Completion of rehabilitation programs; <em>and</em></ol>

              <ol class="text">Any additional context for the conviction—including your age when you were convicted, or mitigating factors like physical or emotional abuse, coercion, untreated abuse/mental illness that led to the conviction.</ol>
              <h4 class="step">Know you rights if you are denied affordable housing in San Francisco because of your criminal record.</h4>
              <p class="text">If an affordable housing provider in SF wants to deny you because of your record<em>, </em>THEY MUST abide by the following rules:</p>
              <ol class="text">They cannot deny you because of a conviction more than 7 years old (based on the date of sentencing) </ol>

              <h4 class="step"> Know your rights to receive a final decision after you respond AND have to bring your case to another level of appeal.</h4>
              <p><strong>Must I get notice of the housing provider’s final decision?</strong></p>
              <p class="text"><em>Yes. </em>An affordable housing provider in SF who makes a final decision to deny you must give you a final notice. If a final negative decision is made based on your criminal record, you should consider challenging the decision to the San Francisco Human Rights Commission. <em>HOW?</em> See STEP 6 below.</p>
              <h4 class="step">Report clear violations to the San Francisco Human Rights Commission within 60 days.</h4>
              <p class="text">If you believe that there has been a violation of the rules above, you should report it to the SF Human Rights Commission. This must be done within 60 days of the violation (when you get your final decision).<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1420" id="footnote-ref-1420">[1420]</a></sup></span> </p>

              <p class="text">You can begin the process of reporting a violation by following these 3 steps:</p>

              <ol class="text"><em>Step 3:</em> After intake, the HRC will try to mediate between you and the housing provide; investigate the alleged violation; and make a finding about whether or not the housing provider broke the law.
