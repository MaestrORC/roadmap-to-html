        <h1>What is an adult high school diploma program? How can it help me?</h1>
        <p class="text">These diploma programs are for adults who didn’t finish high school, and who want to complete the courses normally required for high school graduation (instead of taking a GED or high school equivalency test).<sup><a href="#footnote-2786" id="footnote-ref-2786">[2785]</a></sup> High school diploma programs are offered in most jails and prisons, and in adult schools and community colleges throughout California.<sup><a href="#footnote-2787" id="footnote-ref-2787">[2786]</a></sup> </p>
        <p class="text">In most adult high school diploma programs, you can choose to enroll in traditional classes, or to complete courses at your own pace through individual study and regular check-ins with teachers.<sup><a href="#footnote-2788" id="footnote-ref-2788">[2787]</a></sup> In addition, some programs also allow you to complete correspondence courses through mail or email with teachers (for details on distance learning, see <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_866">PG. 866</a>; for correspondence programs, see <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_868">PG. 868</a>). After completing all of the required courses, you will have to pass an “exit” exam, called the California High School Exit Examination (CAHSEE) to receive your high school diploma.<sup><a href="#footnote-2789" id="footnote-ref-2789">[2788]</a></sup> All students in California public schools must pass the CAHSEE before they are awarded a high school diploma. This includes people who earn their diploma while incarcerated. </p>
