              <div class="questionheading"><a id="_Toc308433809"></a><a id="_Toc308701489"></a><a id="_Toc308855177"></a>What can I do if the dependency court judge ended my reunification services, and I want to try again to reunite with my child? </div>
              <p class="text">If the dependency court judge ended your reunification services with your child(ren), your ability to request a change to the judge’s orders will depend on how much time has passed since the case was closed. You <em>may</em> be able to file what is called a 388 petition.</p>
              <p class="text">If the judge ended your reunification services (for example, because you did not meet the requirements of your case plan in time), and placed your child in long-term foster care or with a legal guardian, or closed your child’s case, you may be able to file papers in dependency court (called a <em>388 petition</em>) asking the judge to change the current court order and give you visitation, custody, and/or end a legal guardianship of your child.<sup><a href="#footnote-2625" id="footnote-ref-2625">[2625]</a></sup> <strong><em>BUT if several years have passed since your child’s dependency case was closed</em></strong>, it may be too late to go back to dependency court and ask to change the court order.<sup><a href="#footnote-2626" id="footnote-ref-2626">[2626]</a></sup> Instead, you can file new papers in <em>family court</em> and ask to change the <em>dependency court</em> order. We briefly explain both processes below.</p>
              <p class="text"><strong>POSSIBILITY #1: If your reunification services ended recently (in approximately the past year):</strong></p>
              <p class="text">You can file a <em>388 petition</em> in the same juvenile dependency court where your child’s case took place. In your <em>388 petition</em>, you will need to explain AND prove to the judge (with documents, actions, and evidence) that:</p>
              <ol class="text">There has been a <em>significant change in circumstances</em> (your life or how you live) or <em>new evidence</em> in your child’s case since the judge made the current court order (see the Helpful Hint box below for more information and examples of significant changes in circumstances); AND</ol>
              <ol class="text">Giving you visitation, custody, or ending the guardianship is in your child’s best interest.<sup><a href="#footnote-2627" id="footnote-ref-2627">[2627]</a></sup></ol>
              <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintSignificant Change in Circumstances</h4>
              <p class="textbox">The “change in circumstances” must generally be <em>major</em> and <em>long-term</em>. The judge wants to see that you are committed to the change and won’t go back to your old situation—for example, that you successfully completed your prison or jail sentence; your parole, probation, or community supervision; and/or resolved whatever issues caused CPS and the court to get involved in the first place. Other examples might include: completing an anger management or domestic violence program and taking steps to fix any previous harm you caused; completing a drug rehabilitation program and staying sober for a year or more; and avoiding criminal activity or arrest for several years<strong> </strong>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2628" id="footnote-ref-2628">[2628]</a></sup> </p>
              <p class="text"><strong>POSSIBILITY #2: If it has been several years since your reunification services ended:</strong></p>
              <p class="text">You must go to family court and file papers asking to change the juvenile dependency court order. To be successful, you will have to show:</p>
              <ol class="text">A <em>significant change in circumstances</em> (how your life is different and improved) since the juvenile dependency court judge made the current court order, AND </ol>
              <ol class="text">Giving you custody or visitation would be <em>in your child’s best interest</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-2629" id="footnote-ref-2629">[2629]</a></sup> </ol>
              <p class="text">NOTE: These are the <em>same</em> things you have to prove for a <em>388 petition</em> (described immediately above). For more information on Family Court, see <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_744">PG. 744</a>. </p>
              <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintWriting a Dependency Court 388 Petition</h4>
              <p class="textbox">You should ask the lawyer who represented you in dependency court (or someone else who is familiar with your case) to help you write the <em>388 petition</em>, since it must be very detailed.<sup><a href="#footnote-2630" id="footnote-ref-2630">[2630]</a></sup> (The court’s Family Law Facilitator may also help explain the 388 petition process.) </p>
              <p class="text">Beginning on the next page, you will find the court’s instructions to how to file a 388 Petition and the two court forms you needed</p>
