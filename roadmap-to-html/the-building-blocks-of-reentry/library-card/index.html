        <h4 class="textbox">WHAT WILL I LEARN about library cards?</h4>
        <ul class="learn-bullets">Why a library card is useful, and how to make the most of resources at the libraryHow to find your local public libraryWhat to bring to the library when you go to apply for a library cardWhat to do if you want a library card but don’t have photo ID How to submit your application for a library card</ul>
        <h3><a id="_Toc352860942"></a>Why would I get a library card, and what are the benefits? </h3>
        <p class="text">Although anyone can go to the public library, you<em> </em>need a library card to borrow books and other materials (to use them outside of the building). Also, some libraries require you to get a library card before you can use the computers or Internet there. Plus, a library card is FREE!</p>
        <p class="text">Benefits of a library card include:</p>
        <ol class="text">Free access to books and media materials. Public libraries contain all kinds of books, movies, music, newspapers, magazines, and more. Anyone can visit a public library and use these materials on-site. </ol>
        <ol class="text">Free access to helpful librarians. Public libraries have librarians on staff who are trained to help with all kinds of research questions. Anyone can walk in and get free research help from a librarian.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Free access to computers and the Internet. Most public libraries have computer labs where anyone can go online for FREE. You can use email, search for information, and visit websites. This can make it much easier to contact people, find jobs and services, do research for school, and look up news and information.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Free access to classes, programs, and events. Many public libraries provide free trainings, computer services, and educational programs and events for community members of all ages. </ol>

          <h4><a href="/the-building-blocks-of-reentry/library-card/how-do-i-get-a-library-card/">How do I get a library card?</a></h4>
            <p class="text">Below are some basic steps. You might do them in a slightly different order, depending on your situation.</p>
            <h4 class="step"><a id="ID_FindPublicLibrary"></a>Find a public library near you. </h4>
            <p class="text">Your local public library will be listed in the yellow pages, or you can call 411 (“Information”) to get the address. You might also try asking at a local community center. A list of public libraries in California, listed by city with addresses and phone numbers, is available online at: <a href="http://www.publiclibraries.com/california.htm">http://www.publiclibraries.com/california.htm</a>. A list of public libraries in California, listed in alphabetical order by library name, with web links, is available at: <a href="http://www.lib-web.org/united-states/public-libraries/california/">http://www.lib-web.org/united-states/public-libraries/california/</a>. </p>
            <h4 class="step">Bring a photo ID and proof of your current address. </h4>
            <ol class="text"><em>If you have a California state ID or driver license</em>, you can use it as both your photo ID and proof of address. </ol>
            <ol class="text"><em>If you don’t have a California state ID or driver license, use any 2 of the following</em> (1 must be a photo ID, and 1 must have your current address): U.S. passport, school ID, any government-issued ID, employee ID, a personal check, credit card statement, rental or property tax receipt, utility bill, or postmarked business mail sent to you at your home address.</ol>
            <ol class="text"><em>If you don’t have a photo ID:</em> California law says that everyone in the state should have access to public libraries.<sup><a href="#footnote-243" id="footnote-ref-243">[242]</a></sup> For this reason, many libraries will make an exception to the photo ID rule. Depending on where you live, your local library may accept a prison ID card, or some other official document with your name and address on it.<sup><a href="#footnote-244" id="footnote-ref-244">[243]</a></sup> To find out if the public library in your area accepts other types of identification, call or visit the library and explain your situation.</ol>
            <h4 class="step">Fill out a library card application form.</h4>
            <p class="text">Ask a librarian for the form, fill it out, and turn it in. The librarian will check your ID and proof of address, process your application, and give you your new library card. The card and processing should be FREE.</p>
            <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTS FOR USING YOUR LOCAL LIBRARY</h4>
            <ul class="textbox">Keep an open mind and enjoy yourself! Don’t be afraid to ask for help from librarians — they are there to help you find books and resources, and use the computers.Take care of any materials you borrow, and keep track of due dates — to be respectful, and to avoid being fined (libraries charge late fees if you return materials past their due date).If you’re using library computers, give yourself extra time in case you have to wait for an open one.Many libraries offer free classes and programs like literacy programs, computer skills classes, etc. Ask a librarian for a list!</ul>
