        <h1>Some of these programs are gender-specific. What if I identify as transgender or gender-variant?</h1>
        <p class="text">The CDCR has outlined its protocol for housing people who identify as trans* in Department Operations Manual (DOM) section 62080.14. If you feel your housing assignment does not match your gender identity, you must go through a diagnostic process with a doctor, then provide documentation of your diagnosis on CDCR Form 128-C3. After you take these steps, a CDCR classification committee will review your case to determine the most appropriate institutional placement and housing assignment under the circumstances. You may also have to file a 602 grievance if you feel your housing needs are not being met. For more information on the 602 grievance process, see <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_173">PG. 173</a>.</p>
        <p class="text">Although the Department Operations Manual does not specifically address transitional housing placement for trans* and gender-variant people, a representative from TGI Justice Project, which advocates for currently and formerly incarcerated people who identify as transgender, gender variant, or intersex, noted that many reentry programs are not trans-friendly. If you are interested in joining a transitional housing program but have questions or concerns based on your gender identity, please contact the free Root &amp; Rebound Reentry Legal Hotline at 510-279-4662, which operates every Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. </p>
        <p class="text">You can also contact the following trans* advocacy organizations. They may have more information about other potential solutions:</p>
