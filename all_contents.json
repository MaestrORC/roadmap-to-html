If your parental rights were terminated recently, you may be able to appeal. For example, if you did not get advance notice of a hearing at which you had the right to be present, and the hearing resulted in an unfavorable decision, your absence at the hearing may be grounds for an appeal.[2355] You should speak to an attorney about your particular circumstances to see whether an appeal is an appropriate solution. If your child has not been adopted, he or she may be able to file a 388 petition to reinstate your parental rights. This remedy may be available under two circumstances: if your child hasn\u2019t been adopted within three years of the termination of your parental rights, OR, regardless of how much time has passed, if both your child and the social service agency agree that adoption is unlikely. See PG. X for more information about 388 petitions. \nMy child was placed in foster care while i was incarcerated. what can i do to reconnect?\nFirst, you should get in contact with Child Protective Services (\u201cCPS\u201d) as soon as you are incarcerated and tell them where you are and that you want to be involved as soon as there is a case regarding your child.Second, you have a right to be present and represented by a lawyer at all of the following hearings:\nThird, most important for you will be the disposition hearing, where the court will decide what you need to do to reunify with your child. CPS will write a case plan that you must follow if you want to reunify with your child upon your release..
