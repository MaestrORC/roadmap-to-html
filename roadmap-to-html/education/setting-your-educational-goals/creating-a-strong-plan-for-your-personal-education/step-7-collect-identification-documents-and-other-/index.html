              <h1>Step 7: Collect identification documents and other records required for attending school</h1>
              <p class="text">Getting identification documents (ID), transcripts, and other important records allows you to enroll in school and apply for jobs. Here are some key items to assemble as you start to plan to go back to school:</p>
              <ol class="text"><strong>Birth Certificate (certified, authorized copy). </strong>A birth certificate is often the first step to obtaining a number of important forms of ID. The fees for birth certificates are different in every county and state. See <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_31">PG. 31</a>. </ol>
              <ol class="text"><strong>Social Security Number/Card</strong>. Your Social Security Number is the second critical form of ID to obtain, as it is required for many elements of schooling, financial aid, employment, and other social services. See <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_38">PG. 38</a>.</ol>
              <ol class="text"><strong>California State ID or Driver’s License.</strong> Your state ID card or driver’s license is an important document because it is an official government-issued photo ID that proves your age and identity, and may prove your legal presence in the U.S. You usually need one of these to apply for jobs (and also to open a bank account and vote). See <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_43">PG. 43</a>.</ol>
              <ol class="text"><strong>Transcripts.</strong> If you completed any college courses inside prison or jail, submit a request for that college to send your transcript to the school you would like to attend. Providing transcripts can help to ensure that you don’t lose any college credits you already earned! Keep in mind, different schools have different rules about the schools and programs from which they accept transfer credits. If you have not taken college-level courses yet, you will still need transcripts from high school (if you completed your high school diploma) or your high school equivalency certificate (like the GED, HiSET, or TASC in California) to apply to and enter a college in California. </ol>
              <ol class="text"><strong>Immunization/Vaccination Records.</strong> You will need your immunization/ vaccination records to register for school (and some jobs). These records prove that you received certain vaccines and medicines as a child for diseases like polio, chicken pox, tuberculosis, and MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella). See <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_840">PG. 840</a></ol>
              <ol class="text"><strong>References and Letters of Recommendation</strong>. Many school programs, colleges, and employers request <strong><em>references </em>with an application</strong>. References should be employers, supervisors, teachers, or mentors who can describe your relevant attributes and characteristics in a positive manner. References should be people you know well, but should NOT be family members. </ol>
              <ol class="text"><strong>Selective Service Registration (MALES ONLY).</strong> If you are a male between the ages of 18 and 25 and live in the U.S., you are required to register for the Selective Service before your 26th birthday. This program provides the Federal Government with a list of men to enlist for military service in the case of a national emergency. See <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_73">PG. 73</a> for more information.</ol>
              <ol class="text"><strong>Criminal Record Information. </strong>This is one final suggestion for preparing to go back to school... getting a copy of your criminal record and cleaning it up where possible. This can be an important first step to reduce the effect of your conviction history on your education and career goals. But you don’t have to actually do this before you go back to school— you can do it any time! That said, we recommend looking into record-cleaning while you are in school and well before you apply for jobs, if possible! See the UNDERSTANDING AND CLEANING UP YOUR CRIMINAL RECORDS CHAPTER, starting on <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_931">PG. 931</a>, for more information.</ol>

              <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintSNarrow your Career Interests</h4>
              <p class="textbox">Once you have a list of potential jobs and careers that you are interested in, you will need to start narrowing it down. You should start by considering your lifestyle and identifying any factors or circumstances that might conflict with a job you are interested in. For example, criminal convictions, family responsibilities, and travel or mobility restrictions can affect whether a particular job or career is a good fit for you.</p>
              <h4 class="textbox">Research the Job Market</h4>
              <p class="textbox">Know what the job market is like in your desired field, in the region where you live, and for workers with different skill levels and education levels. </p>
              <h4 class="textbox">Questions to ask:</h4>
              <ul class="textbox">How hard is it to get a job in the field with or without an educational degree? What do employers look for when hiring? Are there many job openings in the field, or is it very difficult to get hired?<sup><a href="#footnote-2710" id="footnote-ref-2710">[2710]</a></sup> Is the field growing and expanding?</ul>
              <h4 class="textbox">Resources to use:</h4>
              <ul class="textbox">Talk to people in your field of interest, and browse job-search and career guides such as the Occupational Outlook Handbook.<sup><a href="#footnote-2711" id="footnote-ref-2711">[2711]</a></sup> Look online: The California Employment &amp; Development Department (EDD) offers an interactive online job guide, which provides information on hundreds of jobs, available at <a href="http://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/OccGuides/">http://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/OccGuides/</a>.
