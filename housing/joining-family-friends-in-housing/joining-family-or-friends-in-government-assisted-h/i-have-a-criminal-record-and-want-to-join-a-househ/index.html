              <p class="text">It depends on your conviction and the requirements of the government-assisted housing program.</p>
              <p class="text">There is a good chance you will want to join or rejoin a family living in a government-assisted housing unit.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1330" id="footnote-ref-1330">[1330]</a></sup></span> Unfortunately, the laws and policies for adding an individual with a criminal record to an existing household can be complex, and sometimes the interests of other family members who are living in the government-assisted housing unit will conflict with your interests in joining them.</p>
              <p class="text">Here are some COMMON QUESTIONS that often come up, which we will address in this section.</p>
              <ol class="text">May I join my family members in their government-assisted housing unit? (<a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_385">PG. 385</a>)</ol>
              <ol class="text">Does my family have to tell the PHA or owner that I am joining their assisted household? How do they do that? (<a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_386">PG. 386</a>)</ol>
              <ol class="text">Can we challenge a denial if the PHA or owner rejects my application to join the household? How do we do that? (<a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_364">PG. 364</a>) </ol>
              <ol class="text">Do I have any rights if I am rejoining my household in government-assisted housing? (<a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_386">PG. 386</a>)</ol>
              <ol class="text">What are the rules if I just want to be a guest of someone living in government-assisted housing and I have a record? (<a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_388">PG. 388</a>)</ol>
              <ol class="text">What are the rules if I am a live-in aide for someone living in government-assisted housing and I have a record? (<a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_390">PG. 390</a>)</ol>
              <ol class="footnotes"><li><sup id="footnote-1330">1330</sup><p> Studies have shown that a substantial number of public housing residents have family members or significant others with recent criminal history. See Catrina Gouvis Roman, Taking Stock: Housing, Homelessness, And Prison Reentry 24 (2004). It’s likely that members of other federally assisted housing programs are similar. <a href="#footnote-ref-1330">↑</a></p></li></ol>
