            <p>There are minimal due process requirements for probation revocation proceedings.<sup><a href="#footnote-723" id="footnote-ref-723">[723]</a></sup> This means that you don‚Äôt have all of the same rights that you have at trial.<sup><a href="#footnote-724" id="footnote-ref-724">[724]</a></sup> </p>
            <p>You have the following rights:</p>
            <p class="listparagraph">Written notice of the alleged violations and the possible consequences, with enough information to allow you to prepare a defense and obtain mitigating evidence (meaning evidence that would lessen the perceived severity of the violation or help justify it);<sup><a href="#footnote-725" id="footnote-ref-725">[725]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="listparagraph">Disclosure of the evidence against you;<sup><a href="#footnote-726" id="footnote-ref-726">[726]</a></sup></p>

            <p class="listparagraph">The right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.<sup><a href="#footnote-731" id="footnote-ref-731">[731]</a></sup> You have a conditional right under the U.S. and California constitutions to confront witnesses whose statements are used against you in a probation violation hearing.<sup><a href="#footnote-732" id="footnote-ref-732">[732]</a></sup> This means that you or your attorney may cross-examine any people who gave information or testified that you violated your probation.<sup><a href="#footnote-733" id="footnote-ref-733">[733]</a></sup> </p>

            <li id="footnote-723"><p> In Morrissey v. Brewer, the U.S. Supreme Court established minimal due process requirements for parole revocation proceedings under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 408 U.S. 471, 488-89 (1972). With regard to the revocation of probation, the Court subsequently held that ‚Äúa probationer, like a parolee, is entitled to a preliminary and a final revocation hearing, under the conditions specified in Morrissey.‚Äù Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 782 (1973). Thus, the State ‚Äúmust provide the same process [found in Morrissey ] when terminating a probationer from probation.‚Äù State v. Rogers, 144 Idaho 738, 742‚Äì43 (2007); State v. Scraggins, 153 Idaho 867, 871 (2012). While Morrissey and Gagnon holdings make clear that probationers do not retain the full constitutional protections afforded criminal defendants, a probationer has a protected liberty interest in continued probation, and is therefore entitled to due process before probation may be revoked. Morrissey and Gagnon set forth those minimum due process requirements. <em>See</em> State v. Scraggins, 153 Idaho 867, 871 (2012). Cases since Morrissey have reaffirmed those rights and described them more specifically. <em>See</em> People v. Vickers, 8 Cal. 3d 451 (1979) (‚Äú[T]he efficient administration of justice requires that the defendant be assisted by retained or appointed counsel at all revocation proceedings other than at summary proceedings had while the probationer remains at liberty after absconding.‚Äù); <em>see also</em>, Gagnon V.

            <p>Witnesses may not be required to testify in front of you if they are deemed <em>fearful</em> or <em>confidential</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-739" id="footnote-ref-739">[739]</a></sup> </p>
            <ol class="text">‚ÄúFearful witnesses‚Äù are witnesses whose identity is known to you but who: (1) have indicated that they are at a risk of harm if they testify in your presence; or (2) have requested that their contact information be withheld from you. Testimony of a fearful witness can be taken outside the parolee‚Äôs presence, but the parolee‚Äôs attorney must be present.</ol>
            <ol class="text">‚ÄúConfidential witnesses‚Äù are witnesses whose identity you are unaware of and who would be at a risk of harm if their identity were disclosed.<sup><a href="#footnote-740" id="footnote-ref-740">[740]</a></sup> However, if confidential information is used as part of the reason you‚Äôre charged with violating probation, you can request that the prosecutor disclose (reveal) this information or prove that revealing this information would create a risk of harm to the confidential witness.<sup><a href="#footnote-741" id="footnote-ref-741">[741]</a></sup></ol>

            <p>If a very important (called ‚Äúmaterial‚Äù) state witness fails to attend a parole revocation hearing, and the hearing cannot fairly proceed without the witness, the court can postpone the hearing or dismiss the case.<sup><a href="#footnote-742" id="footnote-ref-742">[742]</a></sup> </p>
            <li id="footnote-742"><p> To decide whether the witness‚Äôs testimony would be ‚Äúmaterial,‚Äù the court will weight the importance of the witness‚Äôs expected testimony against the availability and reliability of any alternative source of the same information. Also, if the state‚Äôs material witnesses fail to appear, but your witnesses are present, you and your attorney may want to ask that the court to take the testimony of your witnesses before postponing the rest of the hearing.<em>See</em> Cal. Penal Code ¬ß¬†1050(e).  <a href="#footnote-ref-742">‚Üë</a></p></li>
