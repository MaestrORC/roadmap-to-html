        <h1>Once I’m enrolled in CalWORKs, what rules must I follow?</h1>
        <p class="text">To keep getting CalWORKs benefits, you and your family must stay within income and resource limits.<sup><a href="#footnote-1463" id="footnote-ref-1463">[1462]</a></sup> In addition, you and all of the adults in your family must follow requirements related to Welfare-to-Work activities, reporting changes, and maintaining children’s access to health care and school.</p>
        <ol class="text"><em>Welfare-to-Work:</em> Generally, you and any other adults in your family must participate in welfare-to-work activities for a certain number of hours per week. The hours and activities required of you will depend partly on your family situation, and partly on what county you live in (see <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_471">PG. 471</a>). In special cases, adults may be “exempt” (excused) from welfare-to-work requirements. You may be exempt if you are: disabled for 30+ days; under age 19 and attending school full-time; over age 60; caring for a relative’s child who is at risk of being put in foster care; OR caring for a sick or disabled person.<sup><a href="#footnote-1464" id="footnote-ref-1464">[1463]</a></sup> </ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>Reporting:</em> You must regularly report changes to your income and living situation.<sup><a href="#footnote-1465" id="footnote-ref-1465">[1464]</a></sup> If both you and your child are on CalWORKs, you must report once every 6 months via a Semi-Annual Income Eligibility Report known as “SAR 7.” If only your child gets CalWORKs, you must report once a year. In addition, you must immediately report certain changes within 10 days. </ol>
        <ol class="text"><em>Children: </em>If your child is under age 6, he or she must have all standard immunizations. If your child is of school age and under age 16, he or she must be attending school regularly.<sup><a href="#footnote-1466" id="footnote-ref-1466">[1465]</a></sup></ol>
