                    <p class="text">Legal guardianship is a court order saying that a certain adult—someone who is not the child’s parent—is in charge of taking care of the child.<sup><a href="#footnote-2468" id="footnote-ref-2468">[2468]</a></sup> Guardians have many of the same legal rights and responsibilities as parents do while the guardianship is in place. They can make decisions about where the child lives, the child’s health care, and where the child goes to school.<sup><a href="#footnote-2469" id="footnote-ref-2469">[2469]</a></sup> </p>
                    <p class="text">Remember! In California, there are <em>2 kinds of legal guardianships</em>: (1) <em>probate</em> guardianships and (2) <em>juvenile dependency</em> guardianships. </p>
                    <p class="text">Many guardianships are set up through the probate court, not in juvenile dependency court. If your child is NOT a dependent of the juvenile court, you may want to read about probate guardianships on <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_748">PG.  748</a>. NOTE: A guardian who was appointed through dependency court has the <em>same responsibilities</em> as a guardian appointed in probate court, although they do not have an automatic duty to provide status reports to the court at least once a year. Guardians through dependency court still have the following responsibilities. </p>
                    <p class="text"><strong><em>A guardian through dependency court is responsible for the following for the dependent child:</em></strong></p>
                    <ol class="text">Health care: You can make medical decisions for the child. You can give permission for most medical and dental treatments, and for counseling or therapy. </ol>
                    <ol class="text">Education: You can choose the child’s school and learning program. If he/she needs special education, you can work with the school to write an individualized education program (“IEP”).</ol>
                    <ol class="text">Social services: You can get help for the child from programs such as Head Start, Regional Centers (for children with developmental disabilities), California Children’s Services (for children with physical disabilities or certain medical conditions), and after-school programs.</ol>
                    <ol class="text">Residence: You can decide where the child lives.<sup><a href="#footnote-2470" id="footnote-ref-2470">[2470]</a></sup> </ol>
                    <ol class="text">Financial support: You can choose to support the child by yourself; or, if you want help, you can ask for welfare, foster care payments, or other help.<sup><a href="#footnote-2471" id="footnote-ref-2471">[2471]</a></sup> </ol>
                    <ol class="text">Marriage: You and the court must give permission for the child to get married if he/she wants to do so while under 18.</ol>
                    <ol class="text">Armed forces: You can give permission for the child to join the armed forces if he/she is under 18.</ol>
                    <ol class="text">Driver’s License: You can give permission for the child to apply for a driver’s license. You’ll have to pay for any damage if he/she gets in an accident, and you must get insurance to cover the child. If you change your mind, you can sign a form at the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to cancel the child’s license.</ol>
                    <ol class="text">Misconduct: You can be sued for money damages if the child does something wrong.</ol>
                    <ol class="text">Other responsibilities: The judge can ask you to take on other responsibilities. For example, the judge can set up visits for the child with his/her parents or sisters/brothers.</ol>

                    <p class="text"><em>First, the bad news:</em> If the child is NOT living with you right now, before the judge can make you the child’s guardian and allow the child to live with you, the court staff (or a county social worker) must run a background check on you AND any other adults who live in your home or who will spend significant time with the child.<sup><a href="#footnote-2473" id="footnote-ref-2473">[2473]</a></sup> If you (or any other adult who gets checked) have a criminal record, the judge will not allow the child to live with you UNLESS you get a “criminal record exemption” from the county social service agency.<sup><a href="#footnote-2474" id="footnote-ref-2474">[2474]</a></sup> A criminal record exemption means you must get the county social service agency to excuse your conviction and not hold it against you in the process of becoming the child’s guardian through dependency court.</p>
                    <h5 class="question">What convictions can I NOT get an “exemption” for?</h5>
                    <p class="text">Unfortunately, many convictions are considered <em>“non-exemptible,”</em> which means if you or anyone in your home has a <em>non-exemptible conviction</em> on your criminal record, the judge will NOT allow the child to live with you, even if living with you would otherwise be good for the child.<sup><a href="#footnote-2475" id="footnote-ref-2475">[2475]</a></sup> </p>
                    <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Non-exemptible convictions include:</span> A FELONY conviction for child abuse, child neglect, spousal abuse, other crimes against a child (including child pornography), or for a crime involving violence (including rape, sexual assault, and homicide), and a felony conviction <em>within the last 5 years</em> for physical assault, battery, or a drug- or alcohol-related offense.<sup><a href="#footnote-2476" id="footnote-ref-2476">[2476]</a></sup> </p>
                    <p class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">IMPORTANT EXCEPTION: </span>BUT—and this is a big BUT—if the child is <em>already</em> living in your home, the judge can allow the child to continue living with you, <em>even if</em> you or someone else in the home has a “non-exemptible” conviction, especially if the child is doing well there.<sup><a href="#footnote-2477" id="footnote-ref-2477">[2477]</a></sup></p>

Health &amp; Safety Code § 1522(g). However, certain offenses are “non-exemptible only under specified circumstances,” and the Director of Social Services may have discretion to grant an exemption for an offense that otherwise would be non-exemptible. See In re Esperanza C., 165 Cal. App. 4th 1042, 1057 (2008). In addition, some counties may not have authority to issue an exemption, which means the judge cannot place a child in a home where any person has been convicted of a crime other than a minor traffic violation.

Moreover, if the welfare agency was aware of the person’s criminal record when it originally placed the child in the home, the agency may not argue later that the criminal record is a reason to remove the child. In re Miguel E., 120 Cal. App. 4th 521 (2004). However, if the child was allowed to live with relative as an emergency placement, the welfare agency can remove the child if it later finds that any adult living in the home has a criminal record.
