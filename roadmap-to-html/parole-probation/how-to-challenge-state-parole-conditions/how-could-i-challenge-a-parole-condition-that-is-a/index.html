        <h1>How could I challenge a parole condition that is a problem for me because of a disability that I have?</h1>
        <p>If you cannot satisfy a parole condition because of a disability that you have, or if the parole condition is unfair to you because of your disability, the steps to challenge that condition are different than the appeals process discussed on PG.¬†175. To challenge a parole condition related to a disability that you have, you will first want to figure out which agency put the condition on you‚ÄîParole or the BPH‚Äîbecause the steps for challenging it are different depending on who put the condition in place.</p>
        <p class="text">IF THE CONDITION WAS PUT ON YOU BY PAROLE: You should file a CDCR Form 1824 Request (NOT a Form 22 and Form 602 appeal) (see a sample copy of that form in Appendix¬†Q, PG.¬†310). See the section on ‚ÄúDISABILITIES‚Äù below at PG.¬†181 to learn more about that procedure.</p>
        <p class="text">IF THE CONDITION WAS PUT ON YOU BY THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS (BPH): Normally you don‚Äôt need to file an appeal to challenge a parole condition that the BPH put on you, but it‚Äôs different if that condition relates to your disability or an accommodation that you need. To challenge a BPH condition related to your disability, you should fill out BPH Form 1074 ‚ÄúRequest for Reasonable Accommodation,‚Äù (see a sample copy of that form in Appendix¬†R, PG.¬†313), and send it to the BPH‚Äôs ADA Coordinator at:</p>
        <p>BPH ADA COORDINATOR</p>
        <p>1515 K Street, Suite 600</p>
        <p>Sacramento, CA 95814</p>
        <p>If the response from the BPH is unsatisfactory (doesn‚Äôt solve the issue), you can submit you appeal to the Second and Third levels of appeal. </p>
        <p>Find the forms you need online here: <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/BOPH/Inmates_w_Disabilities_Resource.html">http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/BOPH/Inmates_w_Disabilities_Resource.html</a></p>
        <p><em>IF YOU ARE UNSURE IF PAROLE OR THE BPH PUT THE CONDITION ON YOU: </em></p>
        <p>Ask your parole agent if it was Parole or the BPH, and then follow the appeals process for challenging conditions related to your disability explained above. </p>
