              <h1>Correspondence courses</h1>
              <p class="text">A correspondence course is a course offered by a school or program, where the student is separated from the teacher and course materials are provided through the mail or over the Internet. There is very little interaction between the student and the teacher, communication is usually initiated by the student (whenever the student wants), and students work at their own pace. Although there are some similarities, correspondence courses are not considered a type of distance education under federal law (see the table below for key differences).<sup><a href="#footnote-2890" id="footnote-ref-2890">[2890]</a></sup> </p>
              <h4>The Difference Between Distance Education and Correspondence Courses</h4>
              <p class="text">Although these two terms seem similar and are often confused, they refer to two different learning situations. Distance Education is generally an option that requires Internet access. Although Distance Education is one option to earn credit, due to the need of media/ Internet access, it may not be a possible option for an individual who is currently incarcerated.</p>

                    <p class="text">Like with Distance Education programs, you can earn pretty much any credential that you can earn through traditional schooling through a correspondence course. This includes high school degrees and equivalency certificates, CTE certificates and degrees, associate and bachelor’s degrees, and even graduate academic and professional degrees. </p>
                    <p class="text">Program quality does vary greatly, however. While many accredited schools offer credential programs through correspondence courses, this is where you are most likely to see scam programs offering bogus higher education degrees.

                    <ol class="text"><em>Prisoners’ Guerrilla Handbook to Correspondence Programs in the United States and Canada</em> by Jon Marc Taylor. This is a comprehensive guide to correspondence courses available to incarcerated people, providing detailed program overviews and contact information. At the time of this publication, the handbook is in its 3rd edition, published in 2009 (ISBN: 978-0981938509). Check your facility’s library or education department. It is also available from <a href="http://www.amazon.com">http://www.amazon.com</a> and Barnes &amp; Noble (both are CDCR approved vendors). You can also write to the publisher for information on ordering the book: Biddle Publishing Company and Audenreed Press, P.B.M. 103, Box 1305, Brunswick, ME 04011.</ol>
                    <ol class="text"><em>Prison Education Guide</em> by Christopher Zoukis and edited by Susan Schwartzkopf (through Prison Legal News Publishing). This is a comprehensive guide to correspondence programs for prisoners that It includes a detailed analysis of the quality, cost, and course offerings of all college correspondence programs available to prisoners. The publication costs $49.95, and will be available beginning March 1, 2016 (taking pre-orders now online at <a href="https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/store/products/prison-education-guide/">https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/store/products/prison-education-guide/</a>).

                    <ol class="text">Also, see Appendix D, <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_898">PG. 898</a> for a list of schools that have a history of successfully offering correspondence courses to incarcerated individuals (working within correctional facility restrictions).</ol>
                    <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintStudent Responsibilities for Correspondence Courses</h4>
                    <p class="textbox">If you enroll in a correspondence course while you are incarcerated, you will be responsible for getting all of the required textbooks and materials yourself. You may also be responsible for finding a “proctor” at your institution to administer any midterm or final exams. A proctor is someone who watches over you while you take your exam to make sure that you are the one actually taking the exam, and that you do not cheat. </p>
                    <p class="text"><strong><em>If you’re formerly incarcerated:</em></strong></p>
                    <ol class="text">See Appendix D, <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_898">PG. 898</a> for a list of schools known to offer correspondence courses;</ol>
                    <ol class="text">Check your local public library for information on schools that offer correspondence courses;</ol>
                    <ol class="text">Visit your local America’s Job Centers of California and ask about correspondence programs. </ol>
                    <p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE: </strong>Once you have returned to the community, you will have access to more resources, including the Internet, than when you were incarcerated. We recommend that you take advantage of interactive Distance Education programs or traditional face-to-face programs, as these tend to offer a richer and more integrated educational experience than correspondence courses. </p>
                    <h4 class="textbox">Helpful HintPaying for Correspondence Course</h4>
                    <p class="textbox">You may be eligible to receive financial aid to pay for your correspondence study, but it depends on the school you are taking courses through. Because of federal regulations, schools that offer primarily correspondence courses are not eligible to participate in federal financial aid programs. If more than 50% of the courses the institution offers are correspondence courses, or more than 50% of the students enrolled are taking correspondence courses, then the school is not eligible for federal financial aid. Additionally, a school is not eligible if more than 25% of its students are incarcerated.<sup><a href="#footnote-2892" id="footnote-ref-2892">[2892]</a> </sup>(For more information on financial aid, see Paying For Your Education, <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_881">PG. 881</a>.)</p>
