              <p class="text">Yes. As stated on <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_726">PG. 726</a> your criminal record can be one of many factors a family court judge will consider in deciding what is in the “best interest of the child.”</p>
              <p class="text">For some conviction offenses, the law will <em>automatically ban you</em> from reconnecting with a child or grandchild. For other convictions and criminal history that <em>do not completely prevent you</em> from having custody or visitation with your child, a family court judge will look at this history as one factor of many in deciding what custody and/or visitation plan is in the “best interest of the child.” For example, if you have past convictions for child abuse, first-degree murder of the child’s other parent, or being a 290-sex offender registrant where the victim was a minor, a judge is unlikely to grant full custody or unsupervised visitation. See the chart below, and learn more about how a criminal record will be a factor in a judge’s decision regarding your custody/visitation rights, see <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_725">PG. 725</a>.</p>

In both cases, the judge must state his/her reasons in writing or on the record.
