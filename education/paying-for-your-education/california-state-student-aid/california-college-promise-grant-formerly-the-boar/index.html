              <h4 class="sidebox">NOTE ABOUT CHANGE IN LAW FOR TANF/CALWORKS: </h4>
              <p class="sidebox">If you were qualified for TANF/Calworks but found ineligible because of a drug conviction, your criminal history would have previously disqualified you from the CA College Promis Grant program (see PUBLIC BENEFITS CHAPTER, <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_449">PG. 449</a>, for details about TANF/CalWORKS eligibility). However, this law changed on April 1, 2015. After that date, your conviction history no longer makes you ineligible for TANF/CalWORKS benefits, so you may be able to qualify for program now.</p>
              <p class="text">The California College Promise Grant removes enrollment fees for qualified low-income students applying to California’s Community Colleges. If you qualify for this grant, you can go to community college for free (NOTE: you will still have to pay for other education expenses, such as books and supplies). If you are taking a correspondence course through a California Community College while you are incarcerated, you may qualify for this grant—keep reading to learn more.</p>

                    <p class="text">First, to qualify for the the California College Promise Grant, you must be a California resident. If you are a CA resident, you must also qualify based on one of several other criteria, for example, if you receive government benefits or fall into an eligible income bracket. (For a full list of California College Promise Grant qualifications, see Appendix H, <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_918">PG. 918</a>; for a 2018-2019 California College Promise Grant Application, see Appendix I, <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_919">PG. 919</a>.)</p>
