The PHA cannot deny admission based on this information alone; the PHA must verify the match with a positive fingerprint comparison.<sup><a href="#footnote-1299" id="footnote-ref-1299">[1299]</a></sup><strong>The PHA must give you notice of any proposed action that could harm you. </strong>A PHA must notify the household of any proposed action that could harm you (called an “adverse action” notice).

There are conflicting interests involved in providing the criminal record to both the applicant and the member of the family subject to the criminal record. The FBI “commented that dissemination of criminal records is limited to those with authorization (such as the PHA) and the person who is the ‘subject’ of the record, not to other persons in the household.” 66 Fed. Reg. 28,776, 28,789 (May 24, 2001). HUD disagreed, contending that under its statutory authority, it is required to provide the information to the applicant or tenant so that the applicant or tenant may dispute the determination. <a href="#footnote-ref-1300">↑</a></p></li><li><sup id="footnote-1301">1301</sup><p> 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(q)(2); 24 C.F.R. § 5.903(f); see also 42 U.S.C. §§ 960.204(c), 966.4(l)(5)(iv) (public housing) and 982.553(d) (voucher). The notice and opportunity to contest must also be provided in the case of an eviction or lease enforcement action. <a href="#footnote-ref-1301">↑</a></p></li><li><sup id="footnote-1302">1302</sup><p> Special Note for Advocates: The statutory language shows a policy concern that PHAs maintain the confidentiality of criminal records obtained through the federally authorized process. However, the regulation states that it is not applicable to public information or to criminal records information obtained from law enforcement agencies if the information was not sought pursuant to the regulations. 24 C.F.R. §§ 5.901(c), 5.905(c)(2). This exemption may be too broad. The meaning and full effect of the exclusion and its consistency with the statute has not been tested. The concern is that this may mean that if a PHA obtains information from a private consumer reports agency, it may not have to abide by the confidentiality provisions of the statute. 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1681u. Additionally, the confidentiality provisions of the statute most likely do not cover information the PHA or owner obtains from other sources, such as police blotters and newspaper reports. Nevertheless, advocates should argue that any information obtained from law enforcement agencies that is not otherwise publicly available should be subject to the statutory protections. 24 C.F.R. § 5.901(c). With respect to the management of the records, the statute references “any criminal records received,” whereas other provisions of the statute are limited to information received under the subsection. 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(q), § 13663(f); see also 24 C.F.R. § 982.307(b)(2) (PHA may provide voucher landlords information in PHA files). <a href="#footnote-ref-1302">↑</a></p></li><li><sup id="footnote-1303">1303</sup><p> 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(q)(4), (6); 24 C.F.R. § 5.903(h). <a href="#footnote-ref-1303">↑</a></p></li></ol>
