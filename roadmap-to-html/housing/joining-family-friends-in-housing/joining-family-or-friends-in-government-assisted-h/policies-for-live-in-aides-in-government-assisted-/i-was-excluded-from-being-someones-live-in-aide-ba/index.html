        <h1>I was excluded from being someone’s live-in aide based on my criminal record. What can I do?</h1>
        <p class="text"><em>The </em><strong><em>person requiring aide</em></strong> should ask for a <strong><em>review hearing</em></strong>. Go to PG. 359 to learn how (s)he can challenge this denial of you as his/her live-in aide. There may be situations in which the disabled or elderly resident needing the care has great difficulty finding a live-in aide, or that you meet some unique need of that individual requiring care. In such situations, the disabled/elderly individual needing the live-in aide may request a <em>reasonable accommodation</em> for a disability by asking the PHA or owner <em>to waive its strict screening criteria, and allow the person with the criminal record to reside in the unit as a live-in aide due to the special function he or she plays in the tenant’s life</em>. </p>
