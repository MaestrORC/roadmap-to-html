              <p class="text">Using a notebook, keep a record of all the things you did while incarcerated to prepare yourself to take care of your child in reentry. If you need to go to court after you are released, these types of records won’t prove to a judge that you are immediately ready to take over parenting, but they will help to show the judge that you tried to stay involved with the events in your child’s life, maintain a positive, loving relationship with your child, and work on improving yourself—all things that help your chances to reconnect with your child through the court system.</p>
              <p class="text"><em>Keep track of the following:</em></p>
              <ol class="text">All requests for visitation—even ones where your child’s caregiver refused to allow the visit.</ol>
              <ol class="text">Any educational programs you participate in, like parenting classes or vocational classes, and the dates for every class you attend. Try to collect any documents to show proof of attendance, certificates of completion, or awards you received. These will help to show a judge how hard you worked while incarcerated to be prepared as a parent after your release.</ol>
              <ol class="text">A record of what you have done while incarcerated to keep track of your child and his/her development and well-being. For example, write down the dates and times you called your child and/or the child’s caregiver, received a call, or visited with your child and/or your child’s caregiver. Also keep track of the letters you sent—and ask for updates about your child, like his or her health, report card, physical, social and emotional development, and overall well-being.</ol>
              <ol class="text">Save any letters or pictures you receive from your child’s caregiver while you are incarcerated.</ol>
