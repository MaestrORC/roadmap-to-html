            <p class="text">These diploma programs are for adults who didn’t finish high school, and who want to complete the courses normally required for high school graduation (instead of taking a GED or high school equivalency test).<sup><a href="#footnote-2786" id="footnote-ref-2786">[2785]</a></sup> High school diploma programs are offered in most jails and prisons, and in adult schools and community colleges throughout California.<sup><a href="#footnote-2787" id="footnote-ref-2787">[2786]</a></sup> </p>
            <p class="text">In most adult high school diploma programs, you can choose to enroll in traditional classes, or to complete courses at your own pace through individual study and regular check-ins with teachers.<sup><a href="#footnote-2788" id="footnote-ref-2788">[2787]</a></sup> In addition, some programs also allow you to complete correspondence courses through mail or email with teachers (for details on distance learning, see PG. 866; for correspondence programs, see PG. 868). After completing all of the required courses, you will have to pass an “exit” exam, called the California High School Exit Examination (CAHSEE) to receive your high school diploma.<sup><a href="#footnote-2789" id="footnote-ref-2789">[2788]</a></sup> All students in California public schools must pass the CAHSEE before they are awarded a high school diploma. This includes people who earn their diploma while incarcerated. </p>

            <p class="text">It depends. Specifically, it will depend on your current skills, pace of study, life circumstances, and learning preferences. Depending on the program you enroll in, you might work toward your diploma individually, at your own pace; or you might work with a teacher who creates assignment deadlines and a long-term schedule for you.<sup><a href="#footnote-2790" id="footnote-ref-2790">[2789]</a></sup> </p>
            <h4 class="textbox">GENERAL TIPS</h4>
            <p class="textbox">If you’ve already completed many of the courses required for a diploma program and have only a few left to take, an adult high school diploma program is likely a faster route for you than the GED.If you haven’t completed many high school courses, the GED will probably be a faster path to your high school equivalency certificate.<span class="emphasisitalic">But consider</span>, if you have not taken many high school courses yet, and you have some time to spend on your high school education, you might prefer a diploma program because it can be an opportunity to explore new subjects and skills that you won’t learn in a GED program.<sup><a href="#footnote-2791" id="footnote-ref-2791">[2790]</a></sup> <strong>WARNING: Watch out for scam programs, which will try to charge you money for a fake diploma.

            <p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE:</strong> While high school diploma programs are generally offered at no cost, if you have a high balance in your trust account, your facility may decide to deduct some or all of the cost for some programs from your account.<sup><a href="#footnote-2795" id="footnote-ref-2795">[2794]</a></sup> </p>
            <p class="text"><strong><em>If you’re formerly incarcerated:</em></strong></p>
            <p class="text">Adult high school diploma programs may be available in adult schools or community colleges near you for free or at low cost. Many schools provide adult high school classes for free, and provide books and materials for free as well. Others may charge registration and tuition fees. (However, schools that charge fees may also offer financial aid to low-income students. Check with each school about fees and financial aid.)<sup><a href="#footnote-2796" id="footnote-ref-2796">[2795]</a></sup> Also, community adult literacy programs may offer high school diploma courses and tutoring for free. (For a list of organizations that may offer this service, see Appendix A, PG. 880.) </p>
            <p class="text"><em>If you choose a</em> <em>distance learning </em>or <em>correspondence program</em>, regardless of whether you’re incarcerated or in the community, you may need to pay program fees and buy your own materials (for details about distance learning programs in general, see PG. 866).</p>
            <p class="importantbox"><a id="ED_DiplomaScams"></a>WARNING: Be careful when choosing a high school diploma program. In recent years, the federal government has shut down several degree programs that were charging money for fake diplomas.<sup><a href="#footnote-2797" id="footnote-ref-2797">[2796]</a></sup> These programs are scams. To avoid being scammed by a fake diploma program, watch out for the following clues<sup><a href="#footnote-2798" id="footnote-ref-2798">[2797]</a></sup>:</p>
            <ul class="importantbox">If a program lets you get a diploma without taking classes or tests, it is probably fake. The program offers free tests or classes, but charges for the diploma itself. This is a dead giveaway that the program is illegitimate. The program claims to be affilitated with the federal government. The federal government does not offer high school diploma progams. Only the states approve such programs.</ul>

            <h4 class="textbox">Helpful Hint<strong>Finding a High School Diploma Program</strong></h4>
            <ul class="textbox"><strong>TIP 1</strong>: Many community colleges offer dual enrollment programs or continuing education programs, which allow you to earn an adult high school diploma or equivalency certificate AND get started on earning college credits at the same time.<sup><a href="#footnote-2803" id="footnote-ref-2803">[2802]</a></sup> <strong>TIP 2</strong>: If you have meaningful school, work, or life experience, find out if you can make it count toward your diploma. Some adult schools or programs might give you credit for past high school work, job training, work experience, community service, military service, or self-study. Ask the individual school or program if it will do this.<sup><a href="#footnote-2804" id="footnote-ref-2804">[2803]</a></sup></ul>
            <li id="footnote-2799"><p> If you’re not fluent in English, you must be enrolled in ESL until you reach an 8<sup>th</sup> grade level in listening and reading comprehension. Also, if you don’t have a high school credential, you must enroll in Adult Literacy classes until you log 240 hours of class time or until you earn a GED, whichever comes first.
