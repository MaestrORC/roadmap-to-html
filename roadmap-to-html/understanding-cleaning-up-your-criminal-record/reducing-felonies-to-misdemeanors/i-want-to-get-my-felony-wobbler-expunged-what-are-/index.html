        <p class="text">Having a felony conviction on your record (even after the conviction has been expunged) can be much more damaging than having only a misdemeanor. Reducing your felony “wobbler” conviction to a misdemeanor, whether or not you have it expunged, changes your criminal record so that—going forward—you no longer have a felony conviction on your record.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3042" id="footnote-ref-3042">[3041]</a></sup></sup> </p>
        <p class="text">Here are the benefits of reducing your felony “wobbler” to a misdemeanor: </p>
        <ol class="text">You can say that you were never convicted of a felony when applying for most jobs, housing, public benefits, loans, etc.;<sup><a href="#footnote-3043" id="footnote-ref-3043">[3042]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">You will no longer be disqualified from getting most professional and occupational licenses because of a felony conviction;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3044" id="footnote-ref-3044">[3043]</a></sup></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">You may get back your <em>state</em> gun rights back;<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-3045" id="footnote-ref-3045">[3044]</a></sup></sup> AND</ol>
        <ol class="text">You will get back your right to serve on a jury.<sup><a href="#footnote-3046" id="footnote-ref-3046">[3045]</a></sup></ol>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: FELONY REDUCTIONS &amp; IMMIGRATION ISSUES: As of January 1, 2015, the maximum jail time that a person can be sentenced to for a misdemeanor is 364 days—one day short of a full calendar year. This is important if you are at risk of being deported because of a felony conviction, and your conviction can be reclassified or resentenced as a misdemeanor under Prop. 47. When you get your felony conviction reclassified or resentenced, it is recommended that you ask the judge to say <em>on the record</em> that the maximum sentence for your conviction is now 364 days. This might help you avoid certain negative immigration consequences that are tied to a sentence of 365 days or more.<strong><sup><a href="#footnote-3047" id="footnote-ref-3047">[3046]</a></sup></strong> See PG. 980 for a discussion of the immigration consequences of a criminal conviction and some record cleaning options. </p>
        <li id="footnote-3042"><p> People v. Gilbreth (2007) 156 Cal. App. 4th 53, 57. ("[O]nce a court has reduced a wobbler to a misdemeanor pursuant to . . . [Cal. Penal Code] section 17, the crime is thereafter regarded as a misdemeanor 'for all purposes.' This unambiguous language means what it says, and unless the Legislature states otherwise, a person such as [defendant] stands convicted of a misdemeanor, not a felony, for all purposes upon the court so declaring.") <a href="#footnote-ref-3042">↑</a></p></li>
        <li id="footnote-3043"><p> A few licensing boards/agencies can still consider a conviction as a felony, even after the conviction has been reduced to misdemeanor under 17(b). For example: Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code § 6102 (Cal. State Bar—licensing of attorneys) and Cal. Gov’t Code § 1029(a)(3) (disqualification from employment as peace officer). <a href="#footnote-ref-3043">↑</a></p></li>
        <li id="footnote-3044"><p> Cal. Penal Code § 1203.4; see, e.g., 10 Cal. Code Regs. § 3723(a)(3) (discipline of real estate appraisers—criteria of rehabilitation includes “[j]udicial relief from the consequences of criminal conviction”). <a href="#footnote-ref-3044">↑</a></p></li>
        <li id="footnote-3045"><p> Cal. Penal Code § 29800 imposes a lifetime ban on owning or acquiring a firearm for individuals with felony convictions. It also imposes a 10-year firearm ban for certain misdemeanor convictions. If your conviction is reduced to a misdemeanor that does not carry the 10-year ban, your firearm ban will be automatically lifted. If your conviction is reduced to a misdemeanor that carries a 10-year ban, your prohibition will be lifted after the 10-year period. See People v. Gilbreth, 156 Cal. App. 4th 53, 57 (2007) (a reduction of a felony offense to a misdemeanor precludes its use as a predicate offense under the felon-in-possession statutes). <a href="#footnote-ref-3045">↑</a></p></li>
