              <p class="description">This EDUCATION CHAPTER explains the different options available for pursuing your education whether you are currently incarcerated, preparing for your release or are formerly incarcerated. It also explains the options of student aid and funding in order to pursue your educational goals.</p>
              <p class="text"><em>DISCLAIMER</em> – YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN USING THIS GUIDE: When putting together the <em>Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide</em>, we did our best to give you useful and accurate information. However, the laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> legal guide, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to make sure that the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution’s law library. The <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide. You should always consult your own attorney if you need legal advice specific to your situation.</p>
              <h4 class="textbox">What will I learn in the education chapter?</h4>

              <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Root &amp; Rebound has created a new toolkit, “My Education, My Freedom,” for currently or formerly incarcerated people and people with arrest and conviction histories who are <em>actively pursuing their education </em>(meaning you are either enrolling in school or already enrolled). To learn more and request a copy, please tell us more about your educational plans by writing us at Root &amp; Rebound, 1730 Franklin Street, Suite 300, Oakland, CA 94612, calling us at 510-279-4662, or sending us an email at <a href="mailto:roadmap@rootandrebound.org">roadmap@rootandrebound.org</a>.</p>
