        <h1>What other resources are there for undocumented people and immigrants in California?</h1>
        <p class="text">For more information on what it means to be an undocumented person in the United States, you can contact a referral and information hotline such as 1-888-6-CHIRLA (1-888-624-4752), provided in English and Spanish by the <em>Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles</em>. The hotline is open Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., and can provide direct services or refer you to other organizations that can help you. It is safe for non-citizens and undocumented people to call this hotline. </p>
