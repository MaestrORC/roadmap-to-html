        <h1>I was receiving SSI when I entered prison or jail. What happens to it while I’m incarcerated?</h1>
        <p class="text"><em>It depends</em> on how long your incarceration period lasts—and, specifically, how many full <em>calendar</em> months you spend in prison or jail:<strong> </strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1733" id="footnote-ref-1733">[1733]</a></sup> </p>
        <ol class="text">If your incarceration doesn’t last a full calendar month: Your SSI benefits generally continue without interruption. Once you’ve spent a full calendar month in prison or jail, your SSI benefits get suspended (put on pause).</ol>
        <ol class="text">If your incarceration lasts for less than 12 calendar months in a row: Your SSI benefits stay suspended, but you remain enrolled in SSI. This means once you’re released, Social Security can promptly restart your SSI benefits if it has proof that you’ve been released and proof that you still qualify based on income and resources. You won’t be required to show new proof of your disability—although you should promptly report any changes to your disabled condition. (For details on how to restart your SSI after release from incarceration, see <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_486">PG. 486</a>.)</ol>
        <ol class="text"><a id="PublicBenefits_SSI_Incarceration_more1yr"></a>If your incarceration lasts 1 year or more, and your SSI has been suspended for 12 calendar months in a row: Your SSI gets terminated (officially ended). This means you’re no longer enrolled in SSI. If you want to get SSI after your release, you must file a brand new SSI application, including proof of your income and resources and proof of your disability. Processing your new SSI application may take 12-18 months. (For general information on how to start a new SSI application, see <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_483">PG. 483</a>. For details on how to apply for SSI while incarcerated, see <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_486">PG. 486</a>). </ol>
