Programming is particularly (though not exclusively) geared towards people with both mental health and substance abuse issues. <strong>Program Timeframe</strong>: Participants must have <strong>30 to 180 days</strong> left in their sentences at the time of placement. This means you should begin asking your counselor about the program as you approach your final 180 days. One day in the program is equivalent to one day of incarceration.<strong>Supervision</strong>: On-site correctional staff and employees from the contracted facilities (listed below) supervise program participants 24 hours a day. Participants must also wear ankle monitors.<strong>Locations</strong>: Oroville (Butte County), Bakersfield (Kern County), and Los Angeles, CA (Los Angeles County).<strong>Contacts</strong>:Butte County:		Jody Alsdurf, (530) 533-5272Tri County Treatment2740 Oro Dam BlvdOroville, CA 95966Kern County: 		Jaime Contreras, (661) 861-6111, ex. 43Turning Point of Central California1100 Union Ave.Bakersfield, CA 93307Los Angeles County: 	Michael Brenner, (213) 251-2830HealthRight3602307 West 6th StreetLos Angeles, CA 90057</p>
              <p class="text"><strong><em>Am I eligible for the Male Community Reentry Program (MCRP)?</em></strong></p>
              <p class="text">The MCRP accepts people with all levels of offenses from any institution in the state, so long as you have approximately <strong>30 to 180 days</strong> left in your sentence at the time of placement in the program. To qualify for the program, your <strong>county of last legal residence</strong> must have been Butte County, Kern County, Los Angeles County, or San Diego County. If your county of last legal residence is elsewhere, you may still be able to participate in the MCRP if you <strong>transfer supervision</strong> to one of the four counties listed. </p>
              <p class="text">Certain people are <strong><em>automatically</em> ineligible</strong> for the MCRP. If you meet any of the following criteria, you will not be considered for the program:</p>
              <ol class="text">You are listed on the sex offender registry pursuant to Penal Code section 290, are classified with an R-suffix denoting a past sexual offense, or have been convicted of a sexually violent offense as defined in Health and Safety Code section 6600.</ol>
              <ol class="text">You have a Static Risk Assessment score of five or higher, which means the CDCR has predicted that you are likely to commit a violent offense upon release. This is calculated based on your age, gender, prior convictions, and rules violations.</ol>
              <ol class="text">You have attempted to escape in the past five years</ol>
              <ol class="text">You have active or potential felony holds, warrants, or detainers</ol>
              <ol class="text">You have spent time in the Security Housing Unit or Psychiatric Security Unit within the last year</ol>
              <ol class="text">You are classified as part of Security Threat Group I</ol>
              <ol class="text">You have engaged in A through C-class misconduct within the last year of being in custody. In general, this includes acts that are especially violent (murder, batter, assault), dangerous (arson, damage to valuable property), or dishonest (bribery, forgery of important records, attempts to escape). Notably, while it would typically be considered a class B or C offense, possession of alcohol/drugs may not necessarily disqualify you from the MCRP. </ol>
              <p class="text"><strong><em>How do I apply for the MCRP? </em></strong></p>
              <p class="text">The MCRP is a <strong>voluntary</strong> program, so you must initiate the application process yourself by letting your counselor know you are interested. The application process has three components, all of which your counselor will provide: the application itself, a contract agreeing to certain terms, and mandatory assessments. The assessments use information about your personal background to determine which programs and services will best aid your reentry to society. This includes your history of substance abuse, medical and mental health, education, family background, criminal history, and social functioning.</p>
              <p class="text">Once you have completed these requirements, your application will go through a rigorous screening process lasting anywhere from 30 to 60 days. Medical staff, the warden, and a classification committee will all review your application and provide their input. If you are eligible, the committee may endorse you for placement. The committee makes decisions about placement on a case-by-case basis. </p>
              <ol class="text"><strong>Custody to Community Transitional Reentry Program (CCTRP)**</strong></ol>
              <p class="text">**Sometimes referred to as the “Enhanced Alternative to Custody Program”</p>
              <p class="textbox"><strong>Summary</strong>: Enables <strong>women</strong> to complete their sentences in a residential setting. Services are designed to prevent recidivism by addressing unique challenges women face upon reentry, such as gender-based trauma and mother-child relationships. From early morning until evening, participants partake in special activities and workshops, with some free time available. They may seek outside employment upon approval from the CCTRP staff, but a portion of earnings are held by the program until release.  <strong>Program Timeframe</strong>: Participants must have <strong>45 days to two years</strong> left in their sentences at the time of placement. This means you should start asking your counselors about the program as you approach the last two years of your sentence. One day in the program is equivalent to one day of incarceration.<strong>Supervision</strong>: On-site correctional staff and contracted employees from the WestCare Foundation supervise program participants 24 hours a day.

The CDCR staff then determines eligibility by looking at the nature of your crime, whether you have a history of violence, and your physical, mental, and dental health. According to a 2010 investigation by Legal Services for Prisoners with Children, this process takes anywhere from a few months to over a year</p>

              <ol class="text">You were convicted of a violent felony as defined in Penal Code section 667.5(c) (includes homicide, certain sex crimes, and any robbery).</ol>
              <ol class="text">You were convicted of a serious felony as defined in Penal Code section 1192.7. (includes homicide, certain sex crimes, kidnapping, and certain assault crimes).</ol>

In general, this includes acts that are especially violent (murder, battery, assault), dangerous (arson, damage to valuable property), or dishonest (bribery, forgery of important records, attempts to escape). Notably, while it would typically be considered a class B or C offense, possession of alcohol/drugs may not necessarily disqualify you from the MCRP.</ol>
              <ol class="text">You meet other, undefined exclusionary criteria, which potentially includes a current medical or psychiatric diagnosis, a history of perpetrating child abuse, and the inability to find an appropriate placement site.

              <p class="text">First, you need to obtain an acceptance letter from an existing transitional housing facility.

              <p class="text">Once you are determined to be eligible for the ACP, a CDCR staff member will respond within two weeks to notify you that your eligibility has been approved.

              <p class="text">If your application is denied, the written notice will explain the reasons for denial. You may appeal the denial through normal grievance procedures, or can reapply 30 days after receiving written notice.</p>
