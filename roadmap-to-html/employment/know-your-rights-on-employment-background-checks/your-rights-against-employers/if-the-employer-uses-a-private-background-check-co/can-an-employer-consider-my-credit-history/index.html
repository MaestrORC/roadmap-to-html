        <h1>Can an employer consider my credit history?</h1>
        <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINTIf an employer tells me that they will run a background check, should I still apply for the job?</h4>
        <p class="textbox"><span class="emphasisheavy">Yes! </span>Even if the employer does run a background check, this doesn’t mean that they won’t hire you. 58% of employers allow job applicants to explain the results of their background check before the employer makes a final decision about whether or not to hire them. See <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_558">PG. 558</a> above for some tips on how to discuss your background and record in the most favorable way—showing the employer why s/he should hire you and give you a chance!</p>
        <p class="text">Generally, no. Employers CANNOT look at your credit report unless you are applying for certain high level or sensitive job positions, such as a manager or supervisor within a company, a law enforcement officer, or a position with access to large amounts of cash and/or sensitive financial information.<sup><a href="#footnote-1855" id="footnote-ref-1855">[1854]</a></sup> If you have further questions about your credit history, contact a local legal service organization or call 2-1-1.</p>
        <h4 class="textbox">KNOW YOUR RIGHTSYour Rights If An Employer Runs A Background Check</h4>
        <ul class="textbox">Employers MUST NOTIFY you and get your PERMISSION BEFORE running a background check on you through a private background check company.Employers MUST offer you a copy of the background check report. ALWAYS request a copy of the background check report.Employers CAN see: convictions and pending (unresolved) arrests, charges, or cases; other personal information about you. But they CANNOT see convictions and other negative information that is more than 7 years old.In general, employers CANNOT see: arrests that did not lead to conviction; convictions that have been dismissed/expunged/sealed; participation in court diversion programs; and certain minor marijuana convictions; your RAP sheet; your credit report.If an employer decides not to hire you because of information in your background check report, the employer MUST NOTIFY you beforehand; give you a COPY of the background check report; and give you a chance to CORRECT any errors in your background check report.</ul>
