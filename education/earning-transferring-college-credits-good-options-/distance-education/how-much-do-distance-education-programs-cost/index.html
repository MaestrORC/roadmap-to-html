        <h1>How much do distance education programs cost?</h1>
        <p class="text">The cost of Distance Education programs varies based on the type of program, the delivery media, and the institution that it is offered through. Programs offered through four-year colleges and more prestigious schools will be more expensive than those offered through local community colleges. </p>
        <h4>Two important things to note about Paying for Distance Education: </h4>
        <ol class="text">Distance Education and Fee Waivers</ol>
        <p class="text">Distance Education programs offered through California community colleges may qualify for an enrollment fee waiver through the California Community Colleges Board of Governor’s Fee Waiver program. (For more information on this program and how to qualify, see <em>Paying For Your Education</em>, PG. 871.)</p>
        <ol class="text">Distance Education and Financial Aid</ol>
        <p class="text">You may be able to get financial aid to help you pay for your Distance Education courses. Only accredited Distance Education institutions are allowed to participate in federal financial aid programs. Even if a school or program is eligible to participate, it must choose to do so. To find out if financial aid is available for a particular school or program, check with that institution’s financial aid office (For more information on financial aid, see <em>Paying For Your Education</em>, PG. 871).</p>
        <h3 class="subheading2"> <a id="Educ_CorrespondenceCourses"></a><a id="_Toc352862096"></a>Correspondence courses</h3>
        <p class="text">A correspondence course is a course offered by a school or program, where the student is separated from the teacher and course materials are provided through the mail or over the Internet. There is very little interaction between the student and the teacher, communication is usually initiated by the student (whenever the student wants), and students work at their own pace. Although there are some similarities, correspondence courses are not considered a type of distance education under federal law (see the table below for key differences).<sup><a href="#footnote-2870" id="footnote-ref-2870">[2869]</a></sup> </p>
        <h4>The Difference Between Distance Education and Correspondence Courses</h4>
        <p class="text">Although these two terms seem similar and are often confused, they refer to two different learning situations. Distance Education is generally an option that requires Internet access. Although Distance Education is one option to earn credit, due to the need of media/ Internet access, it may not be a possible option for an individual who is currently incarcerated.</p>
