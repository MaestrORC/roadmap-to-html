        <h1>When can a private employer in California ask about my criminal record?</h1>
        <p class="text">It depends on your city and county. For many years, across the entire state, a private employer could ask certain questions about your criminal record at any time, and most private employers can still ask these questions AT ANY TIME. </p>
        <p class="text">Recently, however, San Francisco passed a “Ban the Box” law that applies to private employers. This means that in SF, employers must wait to ask about records until AFTER they have determined the person would be qualified, just like public employers must around the state. For now, San Francisco is the ONLY county in which “Ban the Box” legislation applies to private employers, but other cities and counties are considering similar legislation. See Appendix G, PG. 623, for a full explanation of the San Francisco law, called the Fair Chance Ordinance. A similar law that applies to private employers located or doing business in the City of Los Angeles passed in December 2016. See Appendix W, PG. 649, for more information about Los Angeles’ Fair Chance Initiative for Hiring.</p>
        <p class="text">In addition, the cities of Richmond, Compton, and Los Angeles have implemented “Ban the Box” laws that apply to government contractors—meaning private employers that have contracts with the local city government. If you are applying to a job with a private contractor in one of those cities, you should find out if “Ban the Box” would apply to you. See Appendix H, PG. 626 to learn about Richmond, CA’s “Ban the Box” law and PG. 649 to learn about the one in Los Angeles.</p>
        <h4 class="textbox">SUmmaryKNOW YOUR RIGHTS: What Employers Can Ask You &amp; When</h4>
        <ul class="textbox">In general, employers CANNOT ask about: arrests that did not lead to conviction; convictions that have been dismissed/expunged/sealed; participation in court diversion programs; and certain minor marijuana convictions.Employers CAN ask about: convictions and pending (unresolved) arrests, charges, or cases.In general, PUBLIC employers can only ask about your record AFTER they decide that you meet the basic job qualifications.In general, PRIVATE employers can ask about your record at any time. “Ban the Box” laws you more rights and protections if you apply for a job with a state or local government agency, and/or in certain local cities and counties.</ul>
