        <h1>When should I apply for federal financial aid?</h1>
        <p class="text">The FAFSA must be filled out at the beginning of the year <em>in which you intend to start school</em>. It becomes available on January 1, and although technically there is no deadline, try to fill it out as soon as possible after that date. Each state and every individual school has its own deadline by which it must receive FAFSA information in order to include federal funds in the financial aid package that it offers you. </p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: If you‚Äôre incarcerated, you should not fill out the FAFSA unless you know you are going to be released in time to attend school <em>that year</em>. FAFSA information is only good for one year. (Everyone who applies for federal student aid must complete a new FAFSA every year.) </p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448153847"></a>I already have student loans, can my student loans be deferred while I am incarcerated? </h3>
        <p class="text">Yes, you can have your loans deferred, but you must apply for a deferment. </p>
        <p class="text">Deferment is a process that permits your to temporarily put your loan payments on hold for up to three years, depending on your loan provider and circumstances. </p>
        <p class="text">If you have: Federal Perkins Loans then contact the school that made your loan or the school‚Äôs servicing agent. </p>
        <p class="text">If you have: Direct Loans or Direct PLUS Loans then contact the Direct Loan Servicing Center at 1-800-848-0979 or online at <a href="http://www.dl.ed.gov">www.dl.ed.gov</a>.</p>
        <p class="text">If you have FFEL Loans (includes FFEL PLUS Loans) then contact the lender or agency holding your loan. For the phone number of the agency in your state, contact FSAIC at 1-800-4-FED-AID.<sup><a href="#footnote-2788" id="footnote-ref-2788">[2788]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text">If you cannot get in touch with your student loan provider then we suggest asking someone on the outside to send you the necessary forms for deferment from your loan provider. Also, we suggest asking your case manager for proof of your incarceration so you can provide that to the loan providers along with the other paperwork. For more information on deferring your student loans while incarcerated, please write Root &amp; Rebound anytime or call us on our hotline every Friday from 9AM to 5PM PST. </p>
