        <h1>Once I’m enrolled in GA/GR, what rules must I follow to stay in the program?</h1>
        <p class="text">It depends on your county.<em> </em>Every county sets its own General Assistance/ General Relief rules. Here are some of the rules to know about:</p>
        <ol class="text">Generally, you must fall under the income and property limits to be eligible. </ol>
        <ol class="text">All counties require you to immediately report<em> any</em> changes to your address, income, or property. Failure to report such changes can result in your losing the GA/GR benefits, even if the change would not otherwise disqualify you. </ol>
        <ol class="text">Some counties may limit how long you can receive GA/GR if you able to work, or require that you apply for Social Security and/ or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) if you are <em>not</em> able to work. </ol>
        <ol class="text">Some counties treat GA/GR as a “loan,” and will make you pay back the GA/GR money you received if you have enough income, get a job, or get approved for SSDI or SSI disability benefits.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Some counties also provide you and/or require you to use employment services to help you find, get, and keep a job. But you can’t be required to join and use employment services if you are “unemployable.” You may be considered unemployable if you are: older than 70 years old; responsible for the substantial and continuous care of a family member; or you are disabled. If you have not been screened by the county welfare agency to determine if you are employable, or you believe the county has made a mistake in determining that you are “employable,” and you have been required to participate in an employment program or denied GA/GR assistance, you should consider appealing. It’s best to contact your local legal aid provider to help with filing your appeal (you can visit the website <a href="http://lawhelpca.org/find-legal-help">http://lawhelpca.org/find-legal-help</a> to browse legal aid providers, and see list of legal aid providers at the back of this guide on PG. 1075).<sup><a href="#footnote-1436" id="footnote-ref-1436">[1435]</a></sup></ol>
