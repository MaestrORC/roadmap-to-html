        <h1>The 3-Day Notice to “Pay Rent or Quit”</h1>
        <p class="text">If your rent is late or not paid in full, the landlord may give you a notice called a “Three-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit.” The landlord cannot give you this notice until the rent is late. This notice must be in writing.</p>
      </article>
          <article>
          <h2><a href="/housing/maintaining-my-housing/evictions-just-the-basics/the-3-day-notice-to-pay-rent-or-quit/what-must-a-3-day-notice-to-pay-rent-or-quit-say/">What must a “3-day notice to pay rent or quit” say?</a></h2>
            <p><strong>By law, the notice must state:</strong></p>
            <ol class="text">The exact amount of rent you owe (generally, this may NOT include late charges or other fees, although some courts have allowed late charges to be included);</ol>
            <ol class="text">That you have a choice of paying the rent or MOVING OUT (“Quit” is the legal term for moving out);</ol>
            <ol class="text">Your correct address;</ol>
            <ol class="text">The name, address and telephone number of the person you are supposed to pay the rent to; AND</ol>
            <ol class="text">If you are allowed to pay rent in person, the usual days and hours the person receiving the rent will be available. <em>Note:</em> If there is some other way you are supposed to pay rent, the landlord may have to explain that to you.</ol>

          <h2><a href="/housing/maintaining-my-housing/evictions-just-the-basics/the-3-day-notice-to-pay-rent-or-quit/what-are-my-options-if-i-get-a-3-day-notice-to-pay/">What are my options if I get a “3-day notice to pay rent or quit”?</a></h2>
            <p class="text">To figure out when the third day is, start counting with the day after you received the notice. If the third day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday, you then have until the next business day to pay or move. </p>
            <p class="text">(1) <strong>One choice</strong> is that you can move out during the 3 days. If you move out at this time, technically, the landlord CANNOT file a court eviction against you. However, some landlords try to do so anyway. If this happens, you should call a legal aid office immediately; see a list of legal aid providers across California on <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_1075">PG. 1075</a> that may be able to assist you. Also, even if you move out within the 3 days, the landlord can later sue you for past rent due. Most landlords will not bother with this.</p>
            <p class="text">(2) <strong>Another choice</strong> is to pay the rent. If you decide to pay, you should pay the ENTIRE AMOUNT that the notice asks for, before the three days are up. Make sure that you get a receipt. If you cannot pay the full amount, you may be better off not paying anything —unless you can agree on a payment schedule with the landlord. If you reach such an agreement, make sure it is in writing and keep a copy of the agreement.</p>
            <p class="text">If you offer the full amount asked for within the 3 days, the landlord MUST ACCEPT the money from you. If you think the landlord might refuse your money, take along a friend to be a witness just in case. After the 3 days, the landlord does not have to accept any money from you. If you decide to try to pay the landlord even though the 3 days are up, you should get a RECEIPT and ask the landlord to agree IN WRITING not to evict you. If the landlord refuses to agree to that, the landlord may still try to evict you.</p>

            <p class="text">The landlord must go to court to evict you.</p>
            <p class="text">After the 3 days are over, the landlord cannot simply put you out in the street, change the locks, or have the police or sheriff evict you without going to court first. The 3-Day notice is only the <em>first step</em> in the eviction process. The landlord must go to court and get a judge’s order to get the rent and the house or apartment back. For a short explanation of the eviction process, see <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_393">PG. 393</a>.</p>
