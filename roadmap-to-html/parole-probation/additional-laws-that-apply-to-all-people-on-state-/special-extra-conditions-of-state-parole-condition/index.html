            <h3>Who sets the special conditions of parole, and how do they decide?</h3>
            <h4 class="sidebox">CAN I ASK FOR MY SUPERVISION LEVEL TO BE REVIEWED/ REDUCED?</h4>
            <p class="sidebox">Yes. Most parolees who complete 180 days of satisfactory parole will automatically be assigned to the ‚Äúminimum supervision‚Äù category EXCEPT for people whose commitment offense is legally classified as ‚Äúviolent‚Äù (<em>see</em> Cal. Penal Code ¬ß¬†667.5); 290 registrants (<em>see</em> Cal. Penal Code ¬ß¬†290); people with cases that received a lot of media or public attention, and certain gang members (as documented on CDCR Form 812-A). If you are not one of the people who is automatically assigned to ‚Äúminimum supervision‚Äù after 180 days of completing satisfactory parole, you can still request a reduction in supervision level by asking the unit supervisor, who can make a decision on a case-by-case basis. (Cal. Penal Code ¬ß¬†3504.)</p>
            <p class="text">The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) and individual parole agents can require you to follow certain additional, <em>special conditions</em>, which are <em>special rules</em> you must follow while you are on parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-448" id="footnote-ref-448">[448]</a></sup> </p>
            <p class="text">If you are a ‚Äúlifer‚Äù in California, or if you were released onto parole before July 1, 2013; or charged with a parole violation before July 1, 2013,<sup><a href="#footnote-449" id="footnote-ref-449">[449]</a></sup> then the BPH can also require you to follow certain additional, special parole conditions in those cases.<sup><a href="#footnote-450" id="footnote-ref-450">[450]</a></sup> </p>
            <p class="text">If you are not a ‚Äúlifer,‚Äù County Superior Court judges are in charge of handling parole conditions and revocations of parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-451" id="footnote-ref-451">[451]</a></sup> County Superior Court judges may impose special parole conditions, but the special conditions must be reasonably related to (having to do with) the offense for which the person spent time in prison, or to the risk of each offender‚Äôs recidivism, and criminal history.<sup><a href="#footnote-452" id="footnote-ref-452">[452]</a></sup> </p>
            <p><em>Special conditions</em> required by CDCR and/or your parole agent will depend on your individual circumstances, including the following factors: your <em>commitment offense</em> (the crime you were incarcerated and are on parole for); criminal history; specific issues that may affect your risk of reoffending (called ‚Äúcriminogenic needs,‚Äù such as substance abuse, and family and social relationships);<sup><a href="#footnote-453" id="footnote-ref-453">[453]</a></sup> specific conditions required by law (called <em>mandatory</em> special condititions ‚Äì see the box below for more information); and other parole expectations. Your <em>special conditions</em> will be part of your parole plan, and can change depending on how well you do on parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-454" id="footnote-ref-454">[454]</a></sup> (See the next question to learn about what your parole plan is.)</p>

            <p class="text">Your parole plan is an individualized plan to guide your parole supervision, which DAPO staff will prepare for you before your release based on an individual evaluation of your strengths, needs, and risks of reoffending. Your parole plan will include the following information: your strengths; risk of reoffending (risk level and ‚Äúcriminogenic needs‚Äù identified during your individual evaluation); goals for successful reentry (these will be related to your specific risk factors); specific ‚Äútriggers‚Äù that may lead to negative behavior (such as strategies for successful reentry and avoiding negative ‚Äútriggers‚Äù; special conditions of parole; supervision category; and other items.<sup><a href="#footnote-455" id="footnote-ref-455">[455]</a></sup> Your supervision category is based on DAPO‚Äôs initial evaluation of your risk of reoffending, and your progress while on parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-456" id="footnote-ref-456">[456]</a></sup></p>
            <p class="text">You should receive a copy of your parole plan before you are released. While you are on parole, you should be meeting regularly with your parole agent to review your parole plan, your progress with specific goals and strategies, and other issues. Your parole agent will modify (change) your parole plan based on your progress and other changes in your situation.<sup><a href="#footnote-457" id="footnote-ref-457">[457]</a></sup> Your supervision category should also be reviewed periodically to determine whether it should be changed.<sup><a href="#footnote-458" id="footnote-ref-458">[458]</a></sup> </p>
            <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Victims and witnesses can also request special conditions, including no-contact provisions and/or that you are not paroled to the county where they live.<sup><a href="#footnote-459" id="footnote-ref-459">[459]</a></sup> Read more about the special conditions that relate to victims and witnessed on PG.¬†178. It‚Äôs also likely that BPH or CDCR will place a no-contact provision for crime partners, preventing you from contacting/seeing anyone who was your co-defendant in the criminal case. Lastly, state law requires some special parole conditions for people convicted of certain types of offenses (these special conditions are called <em>mandatory</em>).<sup><a href="#footnote-460" id="footnote-ref-460">[460]</a></sup> Specifically, there are <em>mandatory</em> special conditions for ‚ÄúSex Offenders‚Äù (see PG.¬†170 for more information) and <em>mandatory </em>special conditions for ‚ÄúMentally Disordered Offenders‚Äù (see PG.¬†174 for more information). </p>
            <h3><a id="_Toc448152814"></a>What are examples of common special conditions of state parole? </h3>
            <p class="text">The most common special conditions for a person on state parole are:</p>
            <p class="listparagraph">You cannot drink alcohol; </p>

            <a id="_Toc448152815"></a>
            <h3>When will I find out the conditions of my parole, and if any extra (special) conditions have been added?</h3>
            <h4 class="sidebox">REFUSING TO COMPLY WITH SPECIAL CONDITIONS</h4>
            <p class="sidebox">Your parole may be revoked for 6 months if you (1) refuse to give any required DNA sample prior to release or (2) refuse to sign any documents acknowledging a duty to register as a sex offender. (<em>See </em>Cal. Penal Code ¬ß¬†3060.5). </p>
            <p class="listparagraph">WHILE INCARCERATED:</p>
            <p>You should find out about the conditions of your parole <em>at least 45 days</em> before your release: your correctional counselor should provide you with this information in a CDCR Form 1515, ‚ÄúNotice and Conditions of Parole.‚Äù<sup><a href="#footnote-465" id="footnote-ref-465">[465]</a></sup> You will be asked to sign the Form 1515.<sup><a href="#footnote-466" id="footnote-ref-466">[466]</a></sup> You will also be given a copy of Form 1515 for you to keep upon your release. </p>
            <p>If possible, even if you don't agree with a special condition given to you in the CDCR Form 1515, it is usually best for you to sign Form 1515 and comply with the conditions while at the same time taking the steps necessary to challenge any disputed condition. If you don't sign the form, you might not get out of prison until the matter is resolved.<sup><a href="#footnote-467" id="footnote-ref-467">[467]</a></sup> </p>
            <p class="listparagraph">ONCE YOU‚ÄôRE RELEASED:</p>
            <p>When you are out and you first meet with your parole agent, your parole officer should give you a copy of your Form 1515 to keep and should explain ALL of the general and special conditions of your parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-468" id="footnote-ref-468">[468]</a></sup> It is important that you fully understand your parole conditions. If you do not understand your parole conditions, ask your parole agent to clear up and answer your questions or concerns.</p>
            <p>If your parole officer doesn‚Äôt present you with the Form 1515 in your first meeting, you should ask him or her to do so. Again, it is very important that the parole agent explains to you your conditions of parole, and if they do not, you should ask them to.</p>
            <h3><a id="_Toc448152816"></a>Am I legally protected from having certain unfair extra (special) conditions imposed on me? </h3>
            <p>Yes. A parole condition is invalid if it fails one of the following 4 legal tests:</p>
            <p><strong>TEST 1: A parole condition is invalid if it:</strong></p>
            <p class="listparagraph">Has no relation to the commitment offense; </p>
            <p class="listparagraph">Bars conduct that is not in itself criminal; and </p>
            <p class="listparagraph">Requires or forbids conduct that is not reasonably related to future criminal conduct or activities.<sup><a href="#footnote-469" id="footnote-ref-469">[469]</a></sup> </p>
            <p><em>You must show that the condition does not meet any of the 3 factors. </em></p>
            <p>For example, courts have held that if a parolee has no history of alcohol abuse or committing crimes while intoxicated, alcohol testing cannot be imposed as a condition of parole because using alcohol is not illegal and the condition would not relate to the parolee‚Äôs past criminal conduct or future criminality.<sup><a href="#footnote-470" id="footnote-ref-470">[470]</a></sup></p>
            <p><strong>TEST 2: A parole condition is invalid if it:</strong></p>
            <p class="listparagraph">Infringes on (violates) a constitutional right AND</p>
            <p class="listparagraph">Is broader than necessary to promote public safety or rehabilitation.<sup><a href="#footnote-471" id="footnote-ref-471">[471]</a></sup> </p>
            <h4 class="sidebox">IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS for people who must register as sex offenders to know</h4>
            <ul class="sidebox">‚ÄúDISTANCE‚Äù is measured by a straight line between the main entrance of the residence and the boundary of the nearest park or school, not the driving or walking distance. (15 CCR ¬ß¬†3571(e)(4).)A ‚Äútransient‚Äù is a person who does not have a residence. A ‚Äúresidence‚Äù is any place where:</ul>
            <p class="listparagraph">You spend 1 day or night at the same address every </p>
            <p class="listparagraph">week for two or more weeks in a row; </p>
            <p class="listparagraph">You spend 2 or more consecutive days or nights living at the same address; </p>
            <p class="listparagraph">You have a key to the address ‚Äúand there is a pattern of residency‚Äù; or</p>

            <p><strong>TEST 3: A parole condition may be invalid if it </strong>is excessively broad or so vague that it cannot be understood and followed.<sup><a href="#footnote-472" id="footnote-ref-472">[472]</a></sup> </p>
            <p>For example, a parole condition prohibiting a parolee from associating with certain groups of people must include a requirement that the parolee knows or should know that any given individual is part of the prohibited group.<sup><a href="#footnote-473" id="footnote-ref-473">[473]</a></sup></p>
