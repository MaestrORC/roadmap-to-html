        <h1>How do I apply for my replacement card from inside?</h1>
        <p class="text">The process for requesting a replacement card while you are incarcerated is the same whether your facility has an MOU with the SSA or not. Follow these steps:</p>
        <h4 class="step">Get and fill out the application for a Social Security Card (Form SS-5).</h4>
        <p class="text">The recommended way to get this form is by calling the Social Security Administration (SSA) at 1-800-772-1213 and asking to have it mailed to you. You may also be able to get the form by writing to your local Field Office or the closest Social Security Administration Regional Office. The Regional Office that serves California is:</p>
        <p class="text">SSA </p>
        <p class="text">Regional Public Affairs Office</p>
        <p class="text">P.O. Box 4201</p>
        <p class="text">Richmond, CA 94804</p>
        <p class="text">Keep in mind that this office also serves Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Mariana Islands, so your request may take some time. The form might also be available from your Correctional Counselor or other prison services staff. (We have included a sample Form SS-5 in Appendix¬†D, PG.¬†103 for reference).</p>
        <h4 class="step">Gather the documents you will need.</h4>
        <p class="text">You will need to submit two documents with your application:</p>
        <ol class="text">Certification of Inmate Identity‚ÄîIf your facility has an MOU agreement with the SSA, there will be a designated prison official who will verify your identity through prison records and issue a ‚Äúcertification‚Äù to the SSA (explanation of MOUs on PG.¬†41 above).<sup><a href="#footnote-46" id="footnote-ref-46">[46]</a></sup> If your facility does not have an MOU agreement with the SSA, you should still ask for a certification. Talk to your correctional counselor; he or she should know who is the best person at the prison to give you a certification. </ol>
        <ol class="text">Information Release‚ÄîYou will need to sign a release of information giving the SSA permission to send your Social Security Card/Number to your facility. Ask your correctional counselor for this form.</ol>
        <h4 class="textbox">HELPFUL HINT</h4>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>Whether or not your institution has an MOU agreement with the SSA, you should include the prison staff‚Äôs ‚Äúcertification‚Äù of your identity, as well as a copy of your Prison ID card, if possible.</em></strong> In fact, you should include any &amp; all documents related to your identification, because the SSA must consider everything. Start gathering documents while you‚Äôre incarcerated. If you don‚Äôt have primary forms of ID, you can use these types of proof after you get released, as well. Along with your birth certificate, these documents will probably be enough. See more info on ‚Äúother proof of identity‚Äù on PG.¬†44.</p>
