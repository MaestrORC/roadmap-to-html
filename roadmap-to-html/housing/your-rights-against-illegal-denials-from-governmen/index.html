        <h2 class="subheading">Your Rights Against Illegal Denials from Government-Assisted Housing Because of Your Criminal Record</h2>
        <h4 class="sidebox">What does “CURRENTLY POSING A THREAT” mean?</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">If you are denied government-assisted housing by a PHA or owner because of criminal activity that DOES NOT threaten anyone’s health, safety, peace, or property, then you have a strong argument to challenge the denial. Go to PG. 389 of this chapter to learn how. Many advocates argue that certain crimes—like prostitution, DUIs, &amp; shoplifting—should not disqualify you because they do not pose any threat to others. The PHA or owner must base his/her decision to deny you on a “reasonable belief” that the criminal activity would<em> threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment</em> of others.</p>

          <h3><a href="/roadmap-to-html/housing/your-rights-against-illegal-denials-from-governmen/how-does-the-law-protect-me-from-being-denied-gove/">How does the law protect me from being denied government-assisted housing because of my criminal record?</a></h3>
            <p class="text">The Public Housing Authority (PHA) or owner of government-assisted housing must follow certain laws and rules when considering your past convictions and criminal history information. They may only reject you for criminal activity that <em>threatens the health, safety, or peace of other residents or staff AND the criminal activity must be “reasonably recent.”</em></p>
            <ol><li><strong>PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing may only reject you for <em>certain kinds of criminal activity</em>—not everything.</strong></li></ol>
            <p class="text">A PHA or owner may only reject you for criminal activity that is:<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1147" id="footnote-ref-1147">[1147]</a></sup></sup></p>

            <ol class="text">Violent.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1149" id="footnote-ref-1149">[1149]</a></sup></sup></ol>
            <ol><li><strong>PHAs and owners of government-assisted housing may only reject you for criminal activity that is <em>reasonably recent</em>. </strong></li></ol>
            <p class="text">A PHA or owner of federal government-assisted housing can only reject you due to criminal activity that is CURRENT or is “REASONABLY RECENT.”<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1150" id="footnote-ref-1150">[1150]</a></sup></sup></p>
            <p class="text">The length of any ban based on criminal records cannot be “unconscionable”—meaning unreasonable and excessive, drastic beyond what’s really needed, or extremely unfair.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1151" id="footnote-ref-1151">[1151]</a></sup></sup></p>
            <h5 class="question">What is considered a “reasonably recent period”? </h5>
            <p class="answer">The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which oversees most federally-funded housing programs (such as Public Housing, the “Section 8” Housing Choice Voucher program, and others), suggests that “5 years may be reasonable for serious offenses” (like making or dealing drugs)<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1152" id="footnote-ref-1152">[1152]</a></sup></sup> and suggests that PHAs and owners should set reasonable time periods for different types of criminal activity in their WRITTEN POLICIES.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1153" id="footnote-ref-1153">[1153]</a></sup></sup></p>
            <p class="address">HUD has also suggested that a conviction for illegal drug use that happened 1 year ago could still be considered “recent.”<strong><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1154" id="footnote-ref-1154">[1154]</a></sup></sup></strong> </p>
            <ol><li><strong>If your criminal conviction was the result of a disability (like past substance abuse or mental illness), you can ask for an exception to the criminal record policy (called a “reasonable accommodation”).</strong></li></ol>
            <p class="text">If you can prove that your conviction was the result of a disability (which includes past drug addiction and mental illness), then you can ask the PHA or owner of government-assisted housing for an exception from their ban as a “reasonable accommodation” to accommodate your disability and give you equal opportunity to access the housing.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><sup><a href="#footnote-1155" id="footnote-ref-1155">[1155]</a></sup></sup></span> Read more about how to do this in Appendix D, PG. 453.</p>
