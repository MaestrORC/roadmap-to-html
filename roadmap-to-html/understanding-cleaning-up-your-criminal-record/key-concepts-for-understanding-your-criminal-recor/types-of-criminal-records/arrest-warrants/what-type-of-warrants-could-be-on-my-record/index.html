              <h1>What type of warrants could be on my record?</h1>
              <p class="text">Below is a brief overview of different types of warrants that could show up on a record:</p>
              <p class="text"><strong>Arrest Warrant:</strong> An <strong>arrest warrant</strong> is issued after a grand jury or law enforcement officials have probable cause to suspect that you have committed a crime. Probable cause requires the knowledge of facts that would lead to a reasonable belief or strong suspicion that you committed a crime.<sup><a href="#footnote-2968" id="footnote-ref-2968">[2968]</a></sup>  A judge will issue an arrest warrant for you if the judge determines a crime has been committed and that “there is reasonable ground to believe” that you committed the crime.<sup><a href="#footnote-2969" id="footnote-ref-2969">[2969]</a></sup></p>
              <p class="text"><strong>Bench Warrant:</strong> A <strong>bench warrant</strong> is issued for failing to obey a court order, such as failing to appear for a court hearing or failing to answer a subpoena. A bench warrant can be issued for the following reasons:</p>
              <ol class="text">Failure to pay a fine;</ol>
              <ol class="text">Failure to appear after an indictment on criminal charges where the court has a fixed date and place for an appearance by the defendant;</ol>
              <ol class="text">Failure to appear in court after an attorney and judge personally order the defendant to appear;</ol>
              <ol class="text">Failure to appear in court and show proof of enrollment, progress or completion of community service or other alternative sentencing; and</ol>
              <ol class="text">Failure to appear (FTA) in court after citation by police officer.</ol>
              <p class="text">A bench warrant gives police the authority to arrest you at any time, but usually doesn’t trigger immediate police action. When a bench warrant is issued against you, your name will go into a statewide computer system that is accessible to the entire law enforcement community. Please note that in serious criminal cases, a failure to appear will most likely cause the court to issue a “regular” arrest warrant; this means the police may immediately try to find and arrest you.</p>
              <p class="text"><strong>Parole Warrant</strong>: A parole warrant can be issued if you violate the terms of your parole, including failure to meet your parole agent. If a parole warrant has been issued against you and you're considered a potential threat to public safety, the California Parole Apprehension Team will be sent to find you. </p>
              <p class="text">Not all parole violations lead to revocation of parole. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has developed a Parole Violation Decision Making Instrument to help parole agents determine whether parole should be revoked or not. If the agent recommends that your parole should be revoked, a parole warrant can be issued.</p>
