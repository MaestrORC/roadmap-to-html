        <h1>How much have deportations increased under President Trump’s administration?</h1>
        <p class="text">Although the number of deportations began to drop in 2012 after a huge increase during President Barack Obama’s first term, the Obama Administration increased the deportation of people with criminal records in recent years. 92% of people living in the U.S. who were deported in 2015 had a past criminal conviction, up from 75% in 2012. </p>
        <p class="text">Many different kinds of criminal convictions and other violations of the law can make a non-citizen deportable or unable to change their immigration status. The important thing to know is that contact with the criminal justice system can have a huge impact on someone’s ability to stay in the U.S. and it is very important to talk to a lawyer before applying for an immigration status, traveling, or talking to law enforcement.</p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT WARNING: If you are contacted by ICE while detained/incarcerated, you have the right to call a lawyer or a loved one/family member, and you have the right to be visited by a lawyer. You have the right to have your attorney with you at a hearing before an immigration judge. You do not have a right to a state-appointed attorney, but it is suggested that your loved one/family member contact the organizations at the end of this fact sheet if you are unable to hire one. You must insist on using your rights and should contact an attorney or have one contacted by a loved one before signing anything with ICE – so you do not give up your rights to fight against deportation.</p>
