        <h1>What educational options do I have while I’m on probation or parole?</h1>
        <p class="text"><em>It depends. </em>Once you are released, you will have access to free resources available in the community—including the Internet, public libraries, and community service organizations—that can help you do research, apply to schools and programs, and get financial assistance (“financial aid”) to help pay for your education. You may also become eligible (qualify) for more types of financial aid once you are released, which can allow you to consider schools or programs that you otherwise might not be able to afford.</p>
        <p class="text"><em>However, </em>the educational options available to you ultimately depend on where you live (urban areas tend to have more options), your life circumstances (such as family responsibilities), and any probation or parole conditions that might affect your access to educational programs and services (such as travel restrictions).</p>
        <p class="textbox"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Your parole agent or probation officer should be supportive and encourage you to pursue your educational goals as part of your successful reintegration.<sup><a href="#footnote-2657" id="footnote-ref-2657">[2656]</a></sup> If you find that s/he is not supportive, or that your conditions make it difficult or impossible for you to get an education, call Root &amp; Rebound’s reentry hotline by calling 510-279-4662, any Friday, 9 a.m. – 5 p.m. PST for strategies, information, and support.</p>
        <h4 class="textbox">A Few Great Resources:</h4>
        <p class="textbox"><a id="ED_Library"></a><span class="emphasisitalic">Public Libraries</span>The local public library is an important gateway to other services and resources in your community. In addition to offering free access to computers and the Internet, libraries often have adult education classes, community calendars (support group meetings, free clinics, etc.), and some government forms that you might need. Librarians are also available to help you find whatever information you need. To find the public library closest to you: </p>
        <ul class="textbox">Check under “library” or “public library” in the city government section of your local phone book; Search the Internet for “library” or “public library” along with the name of your city or county; and/or You can also search the national database of public libraries provided by the Institute of Museum &amp; Library Services at: <a href="http://www.imls.gov/research/public_libraries_in_the_united_states_survey.aspx">http://www.imls.gov/research/public_libraries_in_the_united_states_survey.aspx</a>.</ul>
        <p class="textbox"><a id="Educ_AmerJobCenter"></a><span class="emphasisitalic">America’s Job Centers of California (formerly called EDD One-Stop Centers)</span>America’s Job Centers of California offer many resources, all in one place, for people seeking a job or more education.

        <p class="textbox"><span class="emphasisitalic">Community Organizations</span>Community organizations provide many kinds of services. Most are free, but some may charge a fee. These organizations can help with employment, education, health care, counseling, housing, substance abuse treatment, transportation, and childcare. They also can provide referrals to other agencies. There are different ways you can find community organizations:</p>
        <ul class="textbox">2-1-1: A community information service that connects you to local agencies, services, and organizations that can help you with a variety of needs. To contact 2-1-1: Call 2-1-1 from any phone (note: phone service may not be available in all communities yet);Visit the 2-1-1 Information &amp; Referral Search website at <a href="http://www.211.org">http://www.211.org</a>; orSome communities also publish a paper copy of the 2-1-1 guide.<sup><a href="#footnote-2658" id="footnote-ref-2658">[2657]</a></sup> Check your local public library to see if the paper guide is available in your community.Local Public Library: Often there will be a community message board with contact information for local organizations, or you can ask the librarian to recommend local resources (see above). </ul>
        <p class="textbox"><strong>TIP:</strong> Make a list ready of the resources that you want to research <em>before</em> you go to the library. This will save you a lot of time and help you better organize your search. This is especially important if you are under time limitations because of curfews or restrictions imposed by your parole agent or probation officer.</p>
