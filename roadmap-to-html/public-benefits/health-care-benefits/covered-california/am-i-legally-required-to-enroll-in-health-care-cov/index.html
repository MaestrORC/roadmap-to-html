              <p class="text">If you live in the U.S., and you’re <em>not currently incarcerated</em>, the answer is probably <em>yes</em>. <a id="PB_HealthCare_IndividualMandate"></a>Certain people in special situations (explained below) are excused from this requirement. Unless you have one of these situations, you MUST enroll in health care coverage, or else you must pay a penalty fee when you file taxes.<sup><a href="#footnote-1533" id="footnote-ref-1533">[1533]</a></sup> This legal requirement is called the “individual mandate,” and the tax penalty is called the “shared responsibility fee.”<sup><a href="#footnote-1534" id="footnote-ref-1534">[1534]</a></sup></p>

              <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Currently incarcerated:</span> You’re currently in jail or prison serving a sentence for a conviction. This doesn’t include being held for a case that’s still pending—for example, you’ve been charged but not yet convicted.</ol>

              <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Unable to afford coverage:</span> You can’t afford the cheapest coverage available to you, because it would cost more than 8% of your household income.</ol>
              <ol class="text"><span class="emphasisitalic">Indian tribe:</span> You belong to a federally recognized Indian tribe, or you’re eligible for services through an Indian Health Services provider.<sup><a href="#footnote-1538" id="footnote-ref-1538">[1538]</a></sup></ol>

              <h4 class="sidebox">A Note About Individual Mandate Exemptions</h4>
              <p class="sidebox">Even if you qualify for an exemption, you still can apply and get health care coverage to help pay for medical expenses. An exemption just means that you don’t have to pay the penalty fee—called the “shared responsibility fee”—if you one of the exemption situations applies to you, and you don’t get health care coverage.</p>
              <p class="text">For most of these situations, you must apply to get an exemption. The process varies by situation. </p>
              <p class="text">If you have questions about the forms you need, or if you aren’t sure how to get an exemption for your situation, call Covered California at 1-800-300-1506 (TTY 1-888-889-4500) or the federal government’s Health Insurance Marketplace at 1-800-318-2596 (TTY 1-855-889-4325). Or you may try calling Health Consumer Alliance (HCA), a non-profit organization dedicated to providing information about and helping Californians to get health care.

The fee is set to increase each year from 2014 to 2016. The fee amount you must pay is based on how many months you go without health care during the year.
