              <p class="text">Setting your educational goals involves asking yourself some important questions about your future. What purpose do you want your education to serve?

              <p class="text">Going through some of the questions below may make it easier to make a decision and help you get a clear idea of the goals you want to reach. Often there are several answers to a question, so making lists can help you organize your thoughts and priorities.</p>
