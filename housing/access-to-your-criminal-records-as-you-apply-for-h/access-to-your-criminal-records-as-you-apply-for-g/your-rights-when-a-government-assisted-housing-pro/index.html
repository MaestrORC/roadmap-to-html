                    <p class="text">As discussed on <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_377">PG. 377</a>, a tenant screening report is a background check done by a private company or credit bureau on a housing applicant. It reports credit information, employment history, certain criminal history information, entries on sex offender registers and/or other public databases, driving records, and more. A tenant report may also include information gathered from personal interviews with your neighbors, former landlords, or coworkers.</p>

Reg. 28,776, 28,789 (May 24, 2001).

The notice and opportunity to contest must also be provided in the case of an eviction or lease enforcement action. <a href="#footnote-ref-1322">↑</a></p></li><li><sup id="footnote-1323">1323</sup><p> Special Note for Advocates: The statutory language shows a policy concern that PHAs maintain the confidentiality of criminal records obtained through the federally authorized process. However, the regulation states that it is not applicable to public information or to criminal records information obtained from law enforcement agencies if the information was not sought pursuant to the regulations. 24 C.F.R. §§ 5.901(c), 5.905(c)(2). This exemption may be too broad. The meaning and full effect of the exclusion and its consistency with the statute has not been tested. The concern is that this may mean that if a PHA obtains information from a private consumer reports agency, it may not have to abide by the confidentiality provisions of the statute. 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1681u. Additionally, the confidentiality provisions of the statute most likely do not cover information the PHA or owner obtains from other sources, such as police blotters and newspaper reports. Nevertheless, advocates should argue that any information obtained from law enforcement agencies that is not otherwise publicly available should be subject to the statutory protections. 24 C.F.R. § 5.901(c). With respect to the management of the records, the statute references “any criminal records received,” whereas other provisions of the statute are limited to information received under the subsection. 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(q), § 13663(f); see also 24 C.F.R. § 982.307(b)(2) (PHA may provide voucher landlords information in PHA files). <a href="#footnote-ref-1323">↑</a></p></li><li><sup id="footnote-1324">1324</sup><p> 42 U.S.C. § 1437d(q)(4), (6); 24 C.F.R. § 5.903(h). <a href="#footnote-ref-1324">↑</a></p></li><li><sup id="footnote-1325">1325</sup><p> Housing Authority of Los Angeles, 2018 Administrative Plan, Response to Comments, p. 9, available at <a href="http://home.hacla.org/publicdocs">http://home.hacla.org/publicdocs</a>. <a href="#footnote-ref-1325">↑</a></p></li></ol>

                    <p class="text"><strong><em>The General Rule:</em> </strong>In general, if you believe you were denied housing because of illegal access to your records, or because of incorrect or illegal information, you should IMMEDIATELY ask for a review hearing! A review hearing is an informal procedure in which you can present corrections to your record, evidence of rehabilitation, and other mitigating information (see <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_371">PG. 371</a>) to challenge a denial to government-assisted housing. Go to <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_364">PG. 364</a> of this Chapter to learn about the procedure for challenging denials and how to request an informal review hearing.</p>
