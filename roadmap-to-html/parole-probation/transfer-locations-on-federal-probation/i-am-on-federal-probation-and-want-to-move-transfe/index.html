        <h1>I am on federal probation and want to move/transfer to a new state. How can I do that?</h1>
        <p>To transfer districts, it‚Äôs best to first discuss it with your Probation Officer, who will review your plan and make sure you meet certain criteria required for transfer. To have the transfer request approved, you must get the permission of BOTH your current probation officer AND a probation officer from the new district. Only those transfers that follow the U.S. Parole Commission‚Äôs instructions can be approved.<sup><a href="#footnote-800" id="footnote-ref-800">[800]</a></sup></p>
        <p>Go to PG.¬†261 to learn how to transfer states. An Interstate Compact governs all transfers between states, and applies to all types of supervision (state parole, county probation and other county-level forms of supervision, federal probation, supervised release, and federal parole).</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448152998"></a>What are some <em>positive factors</em> that could help my request to move/ transfer be approved?</h3>
        <p>Most U.S. Probation Districts have some internal criteria for analyzing individual requests to transfer into their District. </p>
        <p>The following are factors that will likely work in your favor if you can show these to your Probation Officer:</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Reliable job offer in new area;</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Proven family and community ties;</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Other positive connections to the new area;</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Reasonable plan for living in the new area (e.g., income, social and family support, etc.);</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">The new address was your legal residence prior to incarceration, and had nothing to do with your criminal offense;</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">You have nowhere else to go and would be homeless if you don‚Äôt move; and</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">The move appears to be in your best interest for other reasons not listed above.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448152999"></a>What are some <em>negative factors</em> that could hurt the chances of my request to move/ transfer from being approved?</h3>
        <p>Most U.S. Probation Districts have some internal criteria for analyzing individual requests to transfer into their District. </p>
        <p>The following are factors that will make it less likely that your request to move or transfer districts is approved:</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">No job offer in new area;</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">No or weak family and community ties in the new area;</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Weak social connections to the new area, or connections that could be a bad influence on you;</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Unreasonable plan for moving (e.g., no income, no social or family connections, etc.);</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">You are unable to provide contact information for the people you are connected to or the people you will be living with at the new address;</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">You appear to be trying to escape a possible violation of your Federal Probation or Supervised Release conditions in your current District;</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">The new address where you want to move is unsafe;</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Someone with a felony or someone who is currently on community supervision for a criminal conviction lives at the new address; and</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">The residence is connected to a previous criminal offense committed by you or by someone who you would be living with.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448153000"></a>I am on federal probation or supervised release. Is it possible to move while a transfer investigation is still pending?</h3>
        <p class="text">Maybe. Sometimes a U.S. Probation Officer will give someone permission to move while an investigation is pending. </p>
        <p class="text">For example, you may be allowed to move before an official approval of your transfer request if:</p>
        <div class="normal2">An eviction is forcing you out of your home and you have nowhere else to live but at the new address in your current district or a different district;You have a job offer that requires you to start on a specific date;Another emergency reason that requires you to move.</div>
        <h4 class="textbox">IF YOUR NEED TO MOVE IS URGENT:</h4>
        <div class="normal2">You should inform your Probation Officer and request a travel permit while the ‚ÄúTransfer Investigation‚Äù and approval are still pending. But please be aware, if the new district completes its ‚ÄúTransfer Investigation‚Äù and denies the transfer request <em>for any reason</em>, you would be required to move back to the original sending district.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-801" id="footnote-ref-801">[801]</a></sup></sup> If you do not move back, you will be violating the Court‚Äôs Order to follow the directions of the Probation Officer. If the court finds you were not following the directions of your Probation Officer, it can revoke your supervision and send you to prison.</div>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448153001"></a>Can I challenge a denial of my transfer request?</h3>
        <p class="text">Yes. If your request to move/transfer has been denied by your current probation officer, you can ask to speak with a Supervising U.S. Probation Officer. However, it is often the case that the request has already gone through a supervisor, and has been denied with the supervisor‚Äôs approval. Other times, a request to move/transfer will be conditionally denied, meaning you could get your request approved later on if you do the things asked of you, like finding a safer home to move to, securing a firmer job offer, finding a different family member to connect with in the new place, etc.<sup><a href="#footnote-802" id="footnote-ref-802">[802]</a></sup></p>
