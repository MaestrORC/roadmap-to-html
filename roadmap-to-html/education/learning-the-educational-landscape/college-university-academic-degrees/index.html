        <h1>College & university academic degrees</h1>
        <p class="text">If you have the desire, time, and financial resources to explore a wider range of academic subjects and skills, you may want to pursue a college degree. In college you can study a diverse range of topics, instead of focusing only on the skills you need for one type of job; and you can develop a broad foundation of writing and critical thinking skills to sharpen your mind and prepare you for a wide variety of careers.<sup><a href="#footnote-2826" id="footnote-ref-2826">[2825]</a></sup> A college degree also may help you qualify for more secure, higher-status, and better-paying jobs.<sup><a href="#footnote-2827" id="footnote-ref-2827">[2826]</a></sup> </p>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>If you’re currently incarcerated:</em></strong></p>
        <p class="text">You likely do not have access to in-person college programs, but you may be able to pursue a college degree through Distance Education. (See <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_866">PG. 866</a> for information on Distance Education programs.) </p>
        <p class="text"><strong><em>If you’re formerly incarcerated:</em></strong></p>
        <p class="text">You can pursue a college degree at a community or junior college, a technical school, or 4-year college or university. While college can be expensive,<sup><a href="#footnote-2828" id="footnote-ref-2828">[2827]</a></sup> there are ways to reduce and supplement the expense (see Paying for College, PG.<strong> </strong>871).<sup><a href="#footnote-2829" id="footnote-ref-2829">[2828]</a></sup> </p>
        <li id="footnote-2826"><p> In addition, attending college can allow you develop social connections with peers and teachers, which can be personally enriching and professionally useful.
