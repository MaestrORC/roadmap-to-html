              <h1>Federal Probation/Supervised Release: Standard Conditions</h1>
              <p class="text"><strong>STANDARD CONDITIONS—</strong> The list of “Standard Conditions” below—while technically discretionary (not required)— are added by the judge in almost every case of Supervised Release, as recommended by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, the agency that oversees federal sentencing guidelines.<sup><a href="#footnote-1157" id="footnote-ref-1157">[1157]</a></sup></p>
              <p class="text">You will likely be ordered to follow most if not all of the following rules (conditions), or something very similar to these:</p>
              <ol class="text">You cannot leave the limits of your judicial district (meaning the area that the court has jurisdiction—i.e. the “Southern District o California”) without written permission from the court or your probation officer.<sup> </sup></ol>
              <ol class="text">You must file a written report with your probation officer within the first 5 days of each month, or as directed by your probation officer.</ol>
              <ol class="text">You must truthfully answer any questions and follow any instructions that your probation officer asks of you.</ol>
              <ol class="text">You must meet your family responsibilities, primarily paying any court-ordered child support or support for the parent with whom your child is living.</ol>
              <ol class="text">You must work regularly at a lawful occupation, unless your U.S. probation officer excuses you for school, training, or other reasons the officer finds acceptable.</ol>
              <ol class="text">You must notify your probation officer at least 10 days before you change your address (some officers will require more or less notice, so check your conditions).</ol>
              <ol class="text">You cannot drink alcoholic beverages to excess. You cannot use or distribute illegal drugs, or frequent places where others use or distribute drugs.</ol>
              <ol class="text">You cannot associate with people engaged in criminal activity. (This means you cannot hang out with or spend time with people who are committing crimes.) </ol>
              <ol class="text">You cannot associate with anyone convicted of a felony unless your U.S. probation officer gives you permission to do so. (Again, this means that unless your probation officer says differently, you are not allowed to hang out with or spend time with someone who has been convicted of a felony. Just spending time with someone who has been convicted of a felony can be considered a violation of your probation, even if you were not doing anything else wrong.) </ol>
              <ol class="text">You must let your probation officer to visit you any time at home or elsewhere.</ol>
              <ol class="text">You must let your probation officer to take any contraband that he or she finds in plain view around you.</ol>
              <ol class="text">You must get in touch with your U.S. probation officer within 3 days (72 hours) if you’re arrested or questioned by law enforcement (again, some officers will require you to report faster, so check your conditions).</ol>
              <ol class="text">You cannot serve as an informant to law enforcement without court permission.</ol>
              <ol class="text">As directed by your U.S. probation officer, you must notify other people about any risks that your criminal record, personal history or characteristics might pose; and you must allow your U.S. probation officer to notify people of any risks posed by your criminal record, personal history or characteristics.</ol>
              <ol class="text">You must pay any court-ordered “special assessment” and fines, and follow any court-ordered payment plan set up for you. </ol>
              <ol class="text">You must notify your U.S. probation officer if there is any significant change in your income or economic circumstances which would impact how much you can pay towards any unpaid restitution, fines, or special assessments (NOTE: this is a mandatory condition for people on federal probation, and a recommended “standard condition” for people on Supervised Release).</ol>
              <ol class="footnotes"><li><sup id="footnote-1157">1157</sup><p> See 18 U.S.C. § 3583; U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(b)-(d) (Standard conditions” are set forth in U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(c)). <a href="#footnote-ref-1157">↑</a></p></li></ol>
