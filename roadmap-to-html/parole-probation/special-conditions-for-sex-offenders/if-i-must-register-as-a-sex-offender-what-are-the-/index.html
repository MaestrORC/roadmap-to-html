        <h1>If I must register as a sex offender, what are the additional mandatory conditions of my parole?</h1>
        <p class="text">The following are the mandatory conditions of parole imposed on sex offenders:</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">REQUIREMENT TO REGISTER—Any person required to register as a sex offender, who “willfully” (intentionally) decides not to register, is guilty of <em>a new criminal charge</em> for failure to register as a sex offender.<sup><a href="#footnote-476" id="footnote-ref-476">[476]</a></sup> If you were originally convicted of a misdemeanor, then the new charge for failure to register will also be a misdemeanor. If you were originally convicted of a felony, the new charge for failure to register will be a felony.<sup><a href="#footnote-477" id="footnote-ref-477">[477]</a></sup> You must register with the local chief of police (or with the county sheriff if your city doesn’t have a local police department).<sup><a href="#footnote-478" id="footnote-ref-478">[478]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="listparagraph">GPS TRACKER—Any person on parole who is required to register as a sex offender must wear a GPS tracking device (usually an ankle bracelet) while on parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-479" id="footnote-ref-479">[479]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="listparagraph">RESIDENCY RESTRICTIONS—There are strict residency restrictions on all parolees who are required to register as sex offenders under California Penal Code § 290 (“290 registrants”). If required to register as a sex offender, you cannot reside within 2,000 feet of any school or park where children regularly gather.<sup><a href="#footnote-480" id="footnote-ref-480">[480]</a></sup> The CDCR may also be able to impose other residency restrictions as special conditions of parole in individual cases based on specific case factors.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-481" id="footnote-ref-481">[481]</a></sup></sup></p>
        <p class="listparagraph">REQUIREMENTS FOR SEX OFFENDER REGISTRANTS – If you are required to register as a sex offender, you must re-register every year, within five business days of your birthday, with the chief of police in the city where you live (or with the county sheriff if there is no city police department).<sup><a href="#footnote-482" id="footnote-ref-482">[482]</a></sup> EXCEPTION: If you are not living in one place, you must register more often as a “transient” sex offender (read the “Important!” text box below) </p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! <em>Information for transient sex offenders: </em>If you are not living in one place (for example, if you don’t have a stable place to live and/or are homeless), then parole considers you “transient,” and you must register with the chief of police in whatever city you are physically present in on that date (or with the county sheriff if there is no city police department). If you move to a new city, you must inform the chief of police (or county sheriff if there is no city police department) in the city where you have relocated.<sup><a href="#footnote-483" id="footnote-ref-483">[483]</a></sup> If you don’t have a stable place to live, you should re-register AT LEAST EVERY 30 DAYS with the chief of police in the city where you are currently present (or with the county sheriff if there is no city police department), no matter how long you have been physically present in that city.<sup><a href="#footnote-484" id="footnote-ref-484">[484]</a></sup></p>
        <li id="footnote-476"><p> Cal. Penal Code § 290.018(b). <a href="#footnote-ref-476">↑</a></p></li>
        <li id="footnote-477"><p> Cal. Penal Code § 290.018(b). <a href="#footnote-ref-477">↑</a></p></li>
        <li id="footnote-478"><p> Cal. Penal Code § 290.46. <a href="#footnote-ref-478">↑</a></p></li>
        <li id="footnote-479"><p> Cal. Penal Code § 3004(b). The statute says that § 290 registrants must be monitored by GPS “for life,” but no law enforcement agency is designated to do such monitoring once parole has ended and no punishment is authorized. Also, the GPS requirement does not apply to persons who were both convicted and released from custody prior to November 8, 2006. Doe v. Schwarzenegger, 476 F. Supp. 2d 1178 (E.D. Cal. 2007); Doe v. Schwarzenegger, No. C 06-06968 JSW (N.D. Cal. Feb. 22, 2007).  <a href="#footnote-ref-479">↑</a></p></li>
        <li id="footnote-480"><p> Cal. Penal Code § 3003.5(b). This rule applies to any sex offender released on parole on or after November 8, 2006, even if the most recent term was for a non-sex offense or the parolee was initially released before November 8, 2006, and later re-released after a parole revocation. In re E.J., 47 Cal. 4th 1258 (2010). However, the residency restrictions cannot be applied to people who were both convicted and released from custody prior to November 8, 2006. Doe v. Schwarzenegger, 476 F. Supp. 2d 1178 (E.D. Cal. 2007). <a href="#footnote-ref-480">↑</a></p></li>
        <li id="footnote-481"><p> For example, parolees convicted of violating Penal Code §§ 288 or 288.5 cannot live within one half-mile (2,640 feet) of a K-12 school if they are deemed “high risk” by CDCR. Cal. Penal Code § 3003(g). Also, a sex offender parolee cannot live in a single family house with another person who is also a sex offender, unless they are related by blood, marriage, or adoption. Cal. Penal Code § 3003.5(a). <a href="#footnote-ref-481">↑</a></p></li>
        <li id="footnote-482"><p> Cal. Penal Code § 290.012(a). <a href="#footnote-ref-482">↑</a></p></li>
        <li id="footnote-483"><p> Cal. Penal Code § 290.011(a). <a href="#footnote-ref-483">↑</a></p></li>
        <li id="footnote-484"><p> Cal. Penal Code § 290.011(b). <a href="#footnote-ref-484">↑</a></p></li>
