              <h1>I want to join someone government-assisted housing. Can I?</h1>
              <p class="text"><em>It depends on your background and on the policies of the PHA or owner. T</em>he same eligibility and exclusion rules apply if you want to <em>join a family living in government-assisted housing </em>as those that would apply if you were applying on your own—see <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_352">PG. 352</a>. As with new applicants there are a few limited situations<em> </em>in which a PHA or owner <em>must</em> reject the new family member<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1309" id="footnote-ref-1309">[1309]</a></sup></span> (see <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_356">PG. 356</a> for bans based on your criminal record). But in the vast majority of situations, the PHA or owner has <em>BROAD DISCRETION</em> to accept or reject you as an additional household member, just like for new applicants. </p>
              <h4 class="sidebox">FIRST, LEARN ABOUT THE CRIMINAL BANS IN GOVERNMENT-ASSISTED HOUSING.</h4>
              <p class="sidebox">Return to the section above about bans to understand when there are <em>required bans</em> vs. when the PHA or owner of government-assisted housing <em>has discretion</em> (meaning is allowed, but not required) to ban you from a government-assisted household. You can also learn how to challenge a denial on <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_359">PG. 359</a> of this Chapter.</p>
              <p class="text">The rules for adding family members to an assisted household are different for every assisted housing program and are determined locally. You should be able to find these rules FOR YOUR PROGRAM. You can look in the following places:</p>
              <ol class="text">The PHA’s Annual Plan</ol>
              <ol class="text">The PHA’s Admission and Occupancy Plan (ACOP)</ol>
              <ol class="text">The lease for public housing</ol>
              <ol class="text">The Administrative Plan for the Section 8 Voucher program</ol>
              <ol class="text">The lease and/or house rules for all other government-assisted programs<sup><a href="#footnote-1310" id="footnote-ref-1310">[1310]</a></sup> </ol>
              <ol class="text">The PHA’s website for these plans</ol>
              <ol class="text">By asking the PHA and/or owner for a copy.</ol>
              <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT: Depending on the type of criminal activity and whether or not if happened on the government-assisted property, it could disqualify not just you, but your entire family from meeting the eligibility requirements of the assisted housing program! (Again, read <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_351">PG. 351</a> to better understand eligibility requirements.)</p>
              <h4 class="sidebox">SPECIAL RULE FOR SECTION 8 VOUCHERS: </h4>
              <p class="sidebox">The PHA is actually required to have a written policy in its “Administrative Plan” about temporary absences for anyone in the “Section 8” Housing Choice Voucher program, so if you are in that program, there will definitely be a local policy! <br/>24 C.F.R. § 982.54(d)(10). The Voucher program’s temporary absence policy must state whether or when the family may be absent—including for imprisonment; the amount of time you are allowed to be absent for; and how to resume your housing assistance. <br/>24 C.F.R. § 982.312(e).</p>
              <h5 class="question"><a id="Report_joining_assisted_household"></a>Does the family in that household have to report the addition to the home? </h5>
              <p class="text">Yes. In general, if a family is adding an adult member to the household, they must (1) tell the PHA and landlord AND (2) in most cases, receive the PHA’s and owner’s approval to add someone new.<span class="followedhyperlink"><sup><a href="#footnote-1311" id="footnote-ref-1311">[1311]</a></sup></span> Ask the PHA and owner what the rules are for reporting a new household member, and ask when you have to report the change. Follow the rules so your family member doesn’t risk losing their housing!</p>
              <ol class="footnotes"><li><sup id="footnote-1309">1309</sup><p> See <a class="page_link" href="/page-index/#page_391">PG. 391</a> for a discussion of the screening criteria relating to individuals with criminal histories. <a href="#footnote-ref-1309">↑</a></p></li><li><sup id="footnote-1310">1310</sup><p> This includes HUD-assisted housing, Rural Development (RD) project-based programs, and Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) properties. <a href="#footnote-ref-1310">↑</a></p></li><li><sup id="footnote-1311">1311</sup><p> 24 C.F.R. §§ 966.4(a)(1)(v), 982.516(c), 982.551(h)(2). Because tenants generally are not aware of the rules set forth in HUD Handbooks, and the lease does not require interim reporting, tenants without notice of the obligation to report should not be penalized for failing to report interim changes in family composition. Compare HUD, Occupancy Requirements Of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs ¶ 7-10(A)(2) (rev. November 2013) (requiring that all tenants notify the owner when a family member proposes to move a new member into the unit), with HUD, Occupancy Requirements Of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs, App. 4-A the model lease, ¶ 16a (does not require interim reporting of changes in family composition). <a href="#footnote-ref-1311">↑</a></p></li></ol>
