        <h1>Parole & Probation</h1>
        <p><strong><img src="36.png"/></strong></p>
        <p class="description">Being under some type of supervision is usually required for you to be released from prison or jail into community. In the PAROLE &amp; PROBATION CHAPTER, you will learn that in California, there are many types of supervision‚Äîstate parole, county probation, Mandatory Supervision, PRCS, federal probation &amp; federal parole. This chapter will help you understand what it means to be under supervision, what special rules you have to follow, and all of the rights you have as a person in reentry.</p>
        <p class="text"><em>DISCLAIMER</em> ‚Äì YOUR RESPONSIBILITY WHEN USING THIS GUIDE: When putting together the <em>Roadmap to Reentry: A California Legal Guide</em>, we did our best to give you useful and accurate information because we know that people who are currently or formerly incarcerated often have difficulty getting legal information, and we cannot provide specific advice to every person who requests it. The laws change frequently and are subject to differing interpretations. We do not always have the resources to make changes to this informational material every time the law changes. If you use information from the <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> legal guide, it is <em>your responsibility</em> to make sure that¬†the law has not changed and applies to your particular situation. If you are incarcerated, most of the materials you need should be available in your institution‚Äôs law library. The <em>Roadmap to Reentry</em> guide is not intending to give legal advice, but rather legal information. No attorney-client relationship is created by using any information in this guide. You should always consult your own attorney if you need legal advice specific to your situation.</p>
