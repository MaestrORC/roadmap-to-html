        <h1>What can I do if I think that the length of my parole is miscalculated?</h1>
        <p class="text">If you believe your parole length has been miscalculated, which does happen time to time, you can and should APPEAL (challenge) your parole term length with CDCR. You have to exhaust the appeals process before you can go to court. </p>
        <p class="text">First, understand the timelines for filing an appeal (see box below). Then, follow the three steps, starting on PG.¬†155, to file your appeal.<strong> </strong></p>
        <a id="PP_602Timelines"></a>
        <h4 class="textbox">TIMELINES FOR ALL 602 APPEALS</h4>
        <p class="textbox">What timelines must I follow in submitting a 602 appeal?</p>
        <ul class="textbox">For submitting an initial 602 administrative appeal, you have 30 days to appeal after the event or decision occurs, or after having first knowledge about the action or decision being appealed;If you get an unsatisfactory response from Parole or CDCR to a 602 appeal, you have 30 days to submit a higher-level appeal.<sup><a href="#footnote-378" id="footnote-ref-378">[378]</a></sup>SPECIAL NOTE: There are special timelines and processes for submitting (1) emergency appeals, (2) appeals of involuntary psychiatric transfer, and (3) disability-related appeals.<sup><a href="#footnote-379" id="footnote-ref-379">[379]</a></sup> What timelines must CDCR/Parole follow in responding to my 602 appeal?</ul>
        <p class="textbox">CDCR/Parole must respond to your 602 appeals within the following time limits:</p>
        <ul class="textbox">Parole has 30 working days (from date of receipt by Appeals Coordinator) to complete and return to you a First Level Response to your 602 appeal.<sup><a href="#footnote-380" id="footnote-ref-380">[380]</a></sup> Parole has 30 working days (from date of receipt by Appeals Coordinator) to complete and return to you a Second Level Response to your 602 appeal.<sup><a href="#footnote-381" id="footnote-ref-381">[381]</a></sup>Parole has 60 working days (from date of receipt by Appeals Chief) to complete and return to you a Third Level Response to your 602 appeal<sup><a href="#footnote-382" id="footnote-ref-382">[382]</a></sup></ul>
        <p class="textbox">The only EXCEPTIONS for CDCR/Parole to take longer than this are if:</p>
        <ul class="textbox">The parolee, staff, or witnesses are unavailable; The complexity of the decision, action, or policy requires additional research;It‚Äôs necessary to involve other agencies or jurisdictions in the appeal; orA state of emergency<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-383" id="footnote-ref-383">[383]</a></sup></sup> requires CDCR and Parole to postpone ‚Äúnonessential administrative decisions and actions, including normal time requirements for such decisions and actions.‚Äù<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-384" id="footnote-ref-384">[384]</a></sup></sup></ul>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">IF THERE IS AN UNREASONABLE DELAY IN GETTING A FORMAL RESPONSE TO YOUR 602:</span> Except for the Third Level of a 602 appeal, CDCR/Parole must provide you <em>in writing</em> with (1) an explanation of the reasons for the delay, and (2) an estimated completion date, and these explanations must be given to you within the time limits above.<sup><a href="#footnote-385" id="footnote-ref-385">[385]</a></sup> SO IF YOU DON‚ÄôT GET A <em>FORMAL WRITTEN RESPONSE</em> to your 602 and never got notified in writing about the delay, then the appeals process is exhausted, and you can raise your issue in court by filing a <em>state petition for a writ of habeas corpus</em> in the superior court of the county of your parole (See PG.¬†297 to learn how). </p>
        <p><strong><em>Keeping the tim</em></strong><a id="file602appeal"></a><strong><em>elines for 602 appeals in mind, you can challenge the length of your parole period by following the steps on the next page.</em></strong></p>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">STEP 1:</span> Submit two forms at the same time: (1) First, submit CDCR Form 22 to your parole agent, requesting an interview to discuss the issue, and (2) Submit a CDCR Form 602 appeal to the Regional Appeals Coordinator at the same time.</p>
        <p class="text">To challenge the length of your parole, you will need to file a CDCR Form 22 (with your parole agent) and a CDCR Form 602 (with your Regional Appeals Coordinator) at the same time. Be sure to attach a copy of the Form 22 to the Form 602 appeal; and vice versa, attach a copy of the Form 602 to the Form 22 request.<sup><a href="#footnote-386" id="footnote-ref-386">[386]</a></sup> </p>
        <ol class="text">SUBMIT FORM 22: To challenge the length of your parole (your CDD, MDD, or PDD), you will need to file a CDCR Form 22, ‚ÄúRequest for Interview, Item or Service‚Äù with your parole agent.<sup><a href="#footnote-387" id="footnote-ref-387">[387]</a></sup> You can get this Form 22 from any parole field office (see Appendix¬†I, PG.¬†292 for an example, but always ask for the most current version of any CDCR form).<sup><a href="#footnote-388" id="footnote-ref-388">[388]</a></sup> If you don‚Äôt already know it, you can find your local parole office‚Äôs address online at: <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Parole/Public_Officers_and_Regional_Offices/">http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Parole/Public_Officers_and_Regional_Offices/</a>. Click on the Region where you are located for a full list of parole offices and addresses in that region. You can also deliver the Form 22 in person to your parole agent at your parole office.</ol>
        <ol class="text">Your parole agent has <em>3 working days</em> from the time he or she receives your Form 22 request to return the original and a copy of the form to you with a response. In the response, your parole agent must: (1) note his or her decision on the form, (2) sign and date the form, and (3) retain a copy for his or her own records.<sup><a href="#footnote-389" id="footnote-ref-389">[389]</a></sup></ol>
        <ol class="text">SUBMIT FORM 602: At the same time, you should submit a formal administrative appeal using CDCR Form 602 (see Appendix¬†J, PG.¬†294 for a blank Form 602 for your reference, but always ask your parole officer for the most current version of any CDCR form) to your Regional Appeals Coordinator.<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-390" id="footnote-ref-390">[390]</a></sup></sup> (See Appendix¬†D on PG.¬†279 for a list of Regional Appeals Coordinators to see who and where you should send your appeal.)</ol>
        <ol class="text">Send your completed CDCR Form 602, with all supporting documents listed on the Form 602 and enclosed with the form. As supporting document, you MUST include both a copy of your CDCR Form 1515 AND a copy of your CDCR Form 22 with your 602 appeal.</ol>
        <p class="importantbox">WARNING: If you send a Form 602 appeal to Regional Appeals Coordinator before filing a more informal Form 22 with you parole agent, the Appeals Coordinator may screen out your 602 for not having first submitted a Form 22 (Parole‚Äôs reasoning is that they want parolees to try and solve these issues informally with their parole agent before a formal appeal is processed). So long as you file the Form 22 and Form 602 at the same time, your 602 appeal should not be screened out because parole agents must respond to the Form 22 requests faster than the Appeals Coordinator has to respond to your Form 602 appeal.</p>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">STEP 2:</span> You should receive a response to your 602 within 30 working days (don‚Äôt count state holidays or weekends). If CDCR <em>denies </em>your 602 appeal at the First Level of Review, you must continue to pursue the administrative appeals process THROUGH ALL 3 LEVELS OF REVIEW before filing a case in court.<sup><a href="#footnote-391" id="footnote-ref-391">[391]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="text">There are special rules for processing 602 appeals concerning miscalculation of your parole discharge date. First level review will be done by the records office staff.<sup><a href="#footnote-392" id="footnote-ref-392">[392]</a></sup> If the appeal is denied at the first level, you can request second level review, which will consist of a ‚Äúcomputation review hearing.‚Äù Unless you waive (give up) your rights, you should be notified at least 24 hours in advance of the date and time of the hearing.<sup><a href="#footnote-393" id="footnote-ref-393">[393]</a></sup> At the end of the hearing, you must be given a copy of the hearing decision on a CDCR Form 1033.<sup><a href="#footnote-394" id="footnote-ref-394">[394]</a></sup> If the appeal is denied, or you are dissatisfied with the decision, you can submit the appeal to the CDCR Appeals Chief as normal for third level review.</p>
        <p class="text"><span class="emphasisheavy">STEP 3:</span> Finally, if you exhaust (complete) <em>all three levels</em> of the 602 administrative appeals process, you can continue to challenge the calculation of your parole length (or any other parole condition) by filing <em>a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus</em> in the superior court of the county of your parole. See the next question, and Appendix¬†K, PG.¬†297 to learn how!</p>
        <h4 class="textbox">REAL-LIFE PRACTICE TIP<br/>for 602 appeals</h4>
        <p class="textbox">In real-life practice, the formal written response to a 602 appeal will often not get back to the parolee who filed it. Sometimes the formal response is sent to a parole agent, who doesn‚Äôt hand it over to the parolee. If you are not physically sent or handed a WRITTEN formal response to your Form 602 appeal (which is different and separate than the written response from your parole agent to a Form 22 request), then this is NOT considered an answer or formal response under law‚Äîbecause it was never given/sent to you. After 30 working days are up, you can try calling your parole agent to find out where the formal response to your 602 is and request a copy be sent to you immediately, but if you are still not given anything after an unreasonable amount of time has passed, then you have exhausted (completed) the administrative appeals process and can file a state petition for a writ of habeas corpus (or file a second 602 appeal about the delay). See PG.¬†155 for detailed information about what to do if you don‚Äôt hear back within the legal time limits. Please note: A short delay is unlikely to be seen as ‚Äúexhausting‚Äù the administrative appeals process‚Äîfor example, a few days or a week late, or a mistake that was immediately fixed by handing you a copy when you asked‚Äîbut if a month or more has passed, this looks more like an unreasonable delay and is likely to be considered exhaustion, allowing you to take the case to state court.</p>
        <h4 class="textbox">IMPORT<a id="responsetimelimit602"></a>ANT! WHAT CAN I DO IF CDCR/ PAROLE IS BREAKING THE LEGAL TIME LIMITS FOR RESPONDING TO MY 602 APPEAL?</h4>
        <div class="widetextboxtext">Unfortunately, it often happens that the CDCR Regional Appeals Coordinator office will not get back to you with a written formal response to your 602 appeal within the timelines required by law. Make sure to ask your parole agent and parole agent‚Äôs supervisor for the formal response to your 602 appeal at any of the three levels of review. If you still do not receive a written FORMAL RESPONSE in person or by mail after asking, you can:(1) File another 602 appeal, noting CDCR and Parole‚Äôs failure to return a formal response to your 602 appeal within the timelines required by law.(2) File a state petition for a writ for habeas corpus in your local California State Superior Court‚Äì stating in the petition that because CDCR/Parole Department didn‚Äôt send you a formal response to your 602 appeal within the legal timelines, you‚Äôve <em>exhausted</em> (completed) the only administrative appeals process available to you.(3) As a more informal action, and to help create a record of what is happening with your original 602, you should:</div>
        <p><em> Call the Regional Appeals Coordinator office requesting a formal response to your 602 be sent to you (and document these phone calls); AND</em></p>
        <p><em> Write and send a dated and signed letter to the Regional Appeals Coordinator where you sent the original 602, </em>noting CDCR and Parole‚Äôs failure to return a formal response to your 602 appeal within the timelines required by law; <em>AND</em></p>
        <p><em> Similarly, write and send a dated and signed letter directly to the parole field office where you report, with attention to your parole agent and your parole agent‚Äôs supervisor, </em>noting CDCR and Parole‚Äôs failure to return a formal response to your 602 appeal within the timelines required by law. In the letter you should include:</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Your full name;</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Your CDC number under your name;</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">A brief explanation of what issues your original 602 appeal was all about. Be sure to include the date that a formal response to your 602 appeal was due back to you; explain what level you are at in the 602 appeals process; and how much time has passed since your formal response was due back to you. You may also want to state any additional facts about the 602 appeal that you believe are relevant; AND</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">A copy of your original 602 appeal, if you have one, as evidence of your appeal. </p>
        <p><strong><em>Why is this suggested?</em> </strong></p>
        <p>It is always better to have any problems that occur with the appeals process PUT INTO WRITING in a letter to the parole office, rather than just have verbal conversations about CDCR/Parole‚Äôs failure to respond with the legal timelines.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Where do you send your letter?</em> </strong></p>
        <p>(1) Send the first letter to your parole agent and the agent‚Äôs supervisor directly to your parole office where you report. Please visit the Division of Adult Parole Operation‚Äôs (DAPO) website at: <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Parole/Public_Officers_and_Regional_Offices/">http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Parole/Public_Officers_and_Regional_Offices/</a> to find the address of your local parole office, if you don‚Äôt already know. Click on the Region where you are located for a full list of parole offices and addresses.</p>
        <p>(2) Send the second letter to the Regional Appeals Coordinator to the office address where you sent your original 602. As of now, it will be one of the following addresses, depending on which region of parole you are located in:</p>
        <p class="text">Northern Region Parole, Appeals Coordinator<br/>9825 Goethe Road, Ste. 200<br/>Sacramento, CA 95827-2572 </p>
