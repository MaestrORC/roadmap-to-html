        <h1>What rights do I have during a parole revocation hearing?</h1>
        <p>Parole cannot be suspended or revoked by the Superior Court Judge unless there is good cause (a good reason) to believe that a person has violated the conditions of his or her parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-566" id="footnote-ref-566">[566]</a></sup></p>
        <p>As a parolee, your rights are as follows:</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Written notice of the alleged violation(s) (the rule or law that parole claims you have broken) and the possible consequences, with enough information to allow you to prepare a defense and obtain evidence that would help explain the situation, or justify it;<sup><a href="#footnote-567" id="footnote-ref-567">[567]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Disclosure of the evidence against you (just like at trial);<sup><a href="#footnote-568" id="footnote-ref-568">[568]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Timely hearing of the charges at a probable cause hearing and a formal revocation hearing (within 90 days if you were not granted bail);<sup><a href="#footnote-569" id="footnote-ref-569">[569]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="listparagraph">The right to present witnesses and documentary evidence.<sup><a href="#footnote-570" id="footnote-ref-570">[570]</a></sup> </p>
        <p class="listparagraph">The right to confront and cross-examine witnesses who speak out against your interest.<sup><a href="#footnote-571" id="footnote-ref-571">[571]</a></sup> You have a conditional right under the U.S. (federal) and California (state) constitutions to cross-examine people whose statements are used against you in a parole violation proceeding.<sup><a href="#footnote-572" id="footnote-ref-572">[572]</a></sup> BUT SEE NOTE BELOW!</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">A neutral and detached (unbiased and fair) hearing body (meaning, the Superior Court Judge);<sup><a href="#footnote-573" id="footnote-ref-573">[573]</a></sup> and</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">A written statement of the decision, the evidence relied on, and the reasons for revoking parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-574" id="footnote-ref-574">[574]</a></sup></p>
        <p class="importantbox">IMPORTANT! You may waive (give up) your right to a parole revocation by admitting that you violated parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-575" id="footnote-ref-575">[575]</a></sup> It is important that you SAY SOMETHING if you believe your rights are violated during the process or in a hearing. If you are unsure if your rights have been violated or if you don‚Äôt understand your rights, ask your lawyer or public defender. If you do not have a lawyer or public defender, call your local public defender‚Äôs office. </p>
        <p class="text">IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT WITNESSES! Witnesses may not be required to testify in front of you at your parole revocation hearing if they are deemed <em>fearful</em> or <em>confidential</em>.<sup><a href="#footnote-576" id="footnote-ref-576">[576]</a></sup> Be sure to speak to your lawyer about all potential witnesses‚Äîthose both for your and against you‚Äîprior to your hearing. </p>
        <p class="text"><strong>‚ÄúFearful witnesses‚Äù</strong> are witnesses whose identity is known to you but who: (1) have indicated that they are at a risk of harm if they testify in your presence; or (2) have requested that their contact information be withheld from you. Testimony of a fearful witness can be taken outside the parolee‚Äôs presence, but your attorney must be present.</p>
        <p class="text"><strong>‚ÄúConfidential witnesses‚Äù</strong> are witnesses, whose identity is not known to you, and who would be at a risk of harm if their identity were disclosed.<sup><a href="#footnote-577" id="footnote-ref-577">[577]</a></sup> However, if confidential information is used as part of the evidence that you violated parole, you can ask the District Attorney (prosecutor) to show you this information. If the District Attorney refuses to show you this information, then he or she must prove that showing you this information would create a risk of harm to the informant. </p>

One of these is that where governmental action seriously injures an individual, and the reasonableness of the action depends on fact findings, the evidence used to prove the Government's case must be disclosed to the individual so that he has an opportunity to show that it is untrue.‚Äù). <em>See also</em> People v. Moore, 34 Cal. 3d 215 (1983) (state has duty to preserve and disclose material physical evidence). <a href="#footnote-ref-568">‚Üë</a></p></li>

        <li id="footnote-572"><p> U.S. Const. amend. VI; Cal. Const. art. I, ¬ß¬†15. Thus, upon the your request, the people who gave the information that proves the parole violation charge should be made available for you to question them at the hearing, unless the judge determines that requiring the witness to appear would create a risk of harm. If the state has ‚Äúgood cause‚Äù (a good explanation or reason) for failing to present a witness and that good cause outweighs your right to confront the witness, the witness‚Äôs prior statements may be presented at the hearing, even if those statements were made outside of court. The more important the witness‚Äôs testimony is to the case, the stronger your right to confront and cross-examine that witness is. Courts may overturn a parole revocation if the hearing officer relies on unsworn hearsay (out of court statements) without determining the unavailability of the declarant or the reliability of the hearsay, or without considering the parolee‚Äôs interests prior to admitting the evidence. <em>See, e.g.</em>, In re Miller, 145 Cal.
