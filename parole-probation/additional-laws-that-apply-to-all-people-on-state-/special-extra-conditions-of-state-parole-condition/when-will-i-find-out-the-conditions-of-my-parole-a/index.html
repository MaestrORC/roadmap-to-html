        <a id="_Toc448152815"></a>
        <h3>When will I find out the conditions of my parole, and if any extra (special) conditions have been added?</h3>
        <h4 class="sidebox">REFUSING TO COMPLY WITH SPECIAL CONDITIONS</h4>
        <p class="sidebox">Your parole may be revoked for 6 months if you (1) refuse to give any required DNA sample prior to release or (2) refuse to sign any documents acknowledging a duty to register as a sex offender. (<em>See </em>Cal. Penal Code ¬ß¬†3060.5). </p>
        <p class="listparagraph">WHILE INCARCERATED:</p>
        <p>You should find out about the conditions of your parole <em>at least 45 days</em> before your release: your correctional counselor should provide you with this information in a CDCR Form 1515, ‚ÄúNotice and Conditions of Parole.‚Äù<sup><a href="#footnote-465" id="footnote-ref-465">[465]</a></sup> You will be asked to sign the Form 1515.<sup><a href="#footnote-466" id="footnote-ref-466">[466]</a></sup> You will also be given a copy of Form 1515 for you to keep upon your release. </p>
        <p>If possible, even if you don't agree with a special condition given to you in the CDCR Form 1515, it is usually best for you to sign Form 1515 and comply with the conditions while at the same time taking the steps necessary to challenge any disputed condition. If you don't sign the form, you might not get out of prison until the matter is resolved.<sup><a href="#footnote-467" id="footnote-ref-467">[467]</a></sup> </p>
        <p class="listparagraph">ONCE YOU‚ÄôRE RELEASED:</p>
        <p>When you are out and you first meet with your parole agent, your parole officer should give you a copy of your Form 1515 to keep and should explain ALL of the general and special conditions of your parole.<sup><a href="#footnote-468" id="footnote-ref-468">[468]</a></sup> It is important that you fully understand your parole conditions. If you do not understand your parole conditions, ask your parole agent to clear up and answer your questions or concerns.</p>
        <p>If your parole officer doesn‚Äôt present you with the Form 1515 in your first meeting, you should ask him or her to do so. Again, it is very important that the parole agent explains to you your conditions of parole, and if they do not, you should ask them to.</p>
        <h3><a id="_Toc448152816"></a>Am I legally protected from having certain unfair extra (special) conditions imposed on me? </h3>
        <p>Yes. A parole condition is invalid if it fails one of the following 4 legal tests:</p>
        <p><strong>TEST 1: A parole condition is invalid if it:</strong></p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Has no relation to the commitment offense; </p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Bars conduct that is not in itself criminal; and </p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Requires or forbids conduct that is not reasonably related to future criminal conduct or activities.<sup><a href="#footnote-469" id="footnote-ref-469">[469]</a></sup> </p>
        <p><em>You must show that the condition does not meet any of the 3 factors. </em></p>
        <p>For example, courts have held that if a parolee has no history of alcohol abuse or committing crimes while intoxicated, alcohol testing cannot be imposed as a condition of parole because using alcohol is not illegal and the condition would not relate to the parolee‚Äôs past criminal conduct or future criminality.<sup><a href="#footnote-470" id="footnote-ref-470">[470]</a></sup></p>
        <p><strong>TEST 2: A parole condition is invalid if it:</strong></p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Infringes on (violates) a constitutional right AND</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">Is broader than necessary to promote public safety or rehabilitation.<sup><a href="#footnote-471" id="footnote-ref-471">[471]</a></sup> </p>
        <h4 class="sidebox">IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS for people who must register as sex offenders to know</h4>
        <ul class="sidebox">‚ÄúDISTANCE‚Äù is measured by a straight line between the main entrance of the residence and the boundary of the nearest park or school, not the driving or walking distance. (15 CCR ¬ß¬†3571(e)(4).)A ‚Äútransient‚Äù is a person who does not have a residence. A ‚Äúresidence‚Äù is any place where:</ul>
        <p class="listparagraph">You spend 1 day or night at the same address every </p>
        <p class="listparagraph">week for two or more weeks in a row; </p>
        <p class="listparagraph">You spend 2 or more consecutive days or nights living at the same address; </p>
        <p class="listparagraph">You have a key to the address ‚Äúand there is a pattern of residency‚Äù; or</p>
        <p class="listparagraph">The parole agent finds evidence of your residency such as clothes or toiletries (15 Cal. Code Regs. ¬ß¬†3590(a)).</p>
        <p><strong>TEST 3: A parole condition may be invalid if it </strong>is excessively broad or so vague that it cannot be understood and followed.<sup><a href="#footnote-472" id="footnote-ref-472">[472]</a></sup> </p>
        <p>For example, a parole condition prohibiting a parolee from associating with certain groups of people must include a requirement that the parolee knows or should know that any given individual is part of the prohibited group.<sup><a href="#footnote-473" id="footnote-ref-473">[473]</a></sup></p>
        <p><strong>TEST 4: A parole condition is invalid if it </strong>limits the type of employment you can have, but does not directly relate to the parolee‚Äôs crime.<sup><a href="#footnote-474" id="footnote-ref-474">[474]</a></sup> </p>
        <p>For example, a parole condition that forbids you from becoming a salesperson because you were previously convicted of fraud for bouncing a check.<sup><a href="#footnote-475" id="footnote-ref-475">[475]</a></sup></p>
        <li id="footnote-465"><p> 15 CCR ¬ß¬†3075.2(b)(2)(A). <a href="#footnote-ref-465">‚Üë</a></p></li>
        <li id="footnote-466"><p> 15 CCR ¬ß¬ß¬†3075.2, 3502. CDCR Form 611 is used for the Release Program Study and CDCR Form 1515 is used to notify parolees of their conditions of parole.  <a href="#footnote-ref-466">‚Üë</a></p></li>

Although the BPH regulations still contain a rule that parolees must sign their conditions of parole, it is unclear whether this provision is still enforced in cases in which the BPH has parole authority.  <a href="#footnote-ref-467">‚Üë</a></p></li>
